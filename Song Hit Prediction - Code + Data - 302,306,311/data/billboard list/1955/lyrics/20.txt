Nat King Cole: A Blossom Fell
-------------------------------

A blossom fell from off a tree
It settled softly on the lips you turned to me
The gypsies say and I know why
"A falling blossom only touches lips that lie."

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied

A blossom fell and very soon
I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon

I thought you loved me
You said you loved me
We planned together
To dream forever

The dream has ended
For true love died
The night a blossom fell
And touched two lips that lied
