Four, tres, two, uno

Listen up y'all cause this is it
The beat that I'm bangin' is delicious

Fergalicious definition
Make them boys go loco
They want my treasure
So they get their pleasures from my photo
You can see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go like seasons

Fergalicious
(So delicious)
But I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses
(Mwah)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be linin down the block
Just to watch what I got
(Four, tres, two, uno)
