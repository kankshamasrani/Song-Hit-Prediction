[ VERSE 1 (loso) ]
You plus me, it equals better math

i'm already bossing, already flossing
but why have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frosting?

(wha wha wha wha) without having the same names
(they they they they they)they may flame -- (buh buh buh buh)but shorty we burn it up
the sag in my swag. pep in my step
