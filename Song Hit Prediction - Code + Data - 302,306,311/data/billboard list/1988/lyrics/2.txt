INXS: Need You Tonight
------------------------

Come over here

All you've got is this moment
21st century is yesterday
You can care all you want
Everybody does, yeah, that's okay

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind
Ooh

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping
There's something about you, girl
That makes me sweat 

How do you feel? (I'm lonely)
What do you think? (Can't think at all)
Whatcha gonna do? (Gonna live my life)

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind
Oh

I need you tonight
'Cause I'm not sleeping
There's something about you, girl
That makes me sweat 

So how do you feel? (I'm lonely)
What do you think? (Can't think at all)
Whatcha gonna do? (Gonna live my life)
How do you feel?
I'm lonely

What do you think? (Can't think at all)
Whatcha gonna do? (Gonna live my life)

So slide over here
And give me a moment
Your moves are so raw
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know 

So slide over here
And give me a moment
I've got to let you know
I've got to let you know
You're one of my kind
