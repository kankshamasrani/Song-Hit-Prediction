Chicago: I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love
-----------------------------------------------

Thought it wouldn't matter
If we didn't stay together
And if it was over
Baby, it was for the better
I was thinking I'd be all right
'Til I thought it all through
Now I know that I ain't really living
If I have to live without you

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you
With you

Guess I had to go away
So much I had to go through
Guess I had to lose you
To realize how much I love you
Can we make the fires burn again?
Burn a little stronger
'Cause I've been alone, and baby
I can't be alone any longer

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you

If I had to make it on my own
My life would never be the same
My love would never be the same
And I don't wanna live without your love

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you

I don't wanna live without your love
I don't wanna face the night alone (I don't wanna live)
I could never make it through my life
If I had to make it on my own
I don't wanna love nobody else (Don't wanna love nobody else)
I don't wanna find somebody new
I don't wanna live without your love
I just wanna live my life with you (Live my life with you)
