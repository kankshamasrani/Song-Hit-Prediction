Erykah Badu: On & On
----------------------

"On and On"

Oh my my my
I'm feeling high
My money's gone
I'm all alone
to much oooh 
The world is turnin'
Oh what a day
What a day, what a day

Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned,
If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned

If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

Oh on and on, and on and on (My cipher keeps moving like a rollin' stone)
Whew on and on, and on and on (All night till the break of dawn)
I go on and on, and on and on (My cipher keeps moving like a rollin' stone)
Ohh on and on, and on and on (God dammit imma sing my song)

I was born underwater with three dollars and six dimes
Yeah you may laugh 'cause you did not do your math

Like one two three
Damn, y'all feel that? Oh...
Like one two three
The world keeps turnin'
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day

The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime and hotter in your fall?

If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

Oh on and on, and on and on (My cipher keeps moving like a rollin' stone)
Whew on and on, and on and on (All night till the vultures soar)
I go on and on, and on and on (My cipher keeps moving like a rollin' stone)
Ohh on and on, and on and on (Mad props to the god Jah Born)

I am feeling kinda hungry 'cause my high is coming down
Don't feed me yours 'cause your food does not endure
I think i need a cup of tea; the world keeps burnin'
Oh what a day, what a day, what a day

You rushin' to destruction 'cause you don't have nothin' left
The mothership can't save you so your ass is gon' get left
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but they fear us just the same

Oh on and on, and on and on (My cipher keeps moving like a rollin' stone)
Whew on and on, and on and on (You can't fuck with me so just leave me alone)
I go on and on, and on and on (My cipher keeps moving like a rollin' stone)
Ohh on and on, and on and on (And on and on)
