Edwin McCain: I'll Be
-----------------------

The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful 
Stop me and steal my breath 
And emeralds from mountains, the thrust towards the sky
Never revealing their depth 
And Tell me that we belong together 
Dress it up with the trappings of love 
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder 
I'll be loves suicide 
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

And rain falls angry on the tin roof
As we lie awake in my bed
And you're my survival, you're my living proof
My love is alive and not dead

And tell me that we belong together
Dress it up with the trappings of love
I'll be captivated, I'll hang from your lips
Instead of the gallows of heartache that hang from above

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder 
I'll be loves suicide 
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Well I've dropped out,
I've burned up, 
I've fought my way back from the dead
Tuned in, 
Turned on, 
Remembered the things that you said

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder 
I'll be loves suicide 
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

And I'll be your cryin' shoulder 
I'll be loves suicide 
And I'll be better when I'm older
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

The greatest fan of your life
