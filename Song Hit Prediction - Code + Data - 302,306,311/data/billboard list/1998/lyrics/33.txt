Wyclef Jean: Gone Till November
---------------------------------

Intro: (spoken)

I dedicate this record, the carnival to all you brothers takin' long
Trips down south, virginia, baltimore, all around the world, and your
Girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back. she's sittin' back
In the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in
Pow!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you

Chorus: (sung)

Every time I make a run, girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you got to understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til november
Said I'll be gone 'til november, yo I'll be gone 'til november
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til november
I'll be gone 'til november, I'll be gone 'til november
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til november
January, february, march, april, may
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til november, I'll be gone 'til november
And give a kiss to my mother

Verse 1: (sung)

When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, go to school in september
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woh oh oh oh
You sucker mc's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o

Repeat chorus

Verse 2: (rap)

I had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a punk (bing!)
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down
It's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your rolls royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I'll commit it that I'll be back in november

Repeat chorus

I know the hustle's hard, but we gotta enterprise, the carnival
