Usher: Nice & Slow
--------------------

What'cha doing?
Really?
You know I'm coming over right?
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
Now you got it hot for me already baby?
Okay.
I'll be there in about uh, give me 10 minutes.
Be ready.
Hey.
Wear that little thing I like.
Bye.
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

It's 7:00 on the dot
I'm in my drop top
Cruisin' the streets, oh yeah
I gotta real pretty, pretty little thing that's waiting for me

I pull up, anticipating good love
Don't keep me waiting
I got plans to put my hands in places
I've never seen, girl you know what I mean

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow

(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
See I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be makin' love until the sun comes up
Baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

Now here we are, drivin' round town
Contemplating where I'm gonna lay you down
Girl you got me sayin'
My, my, my (my) I wish that I
Could pull over and get this thing started right now

I wanna do something freaky to you, baby
I don't think they heard me
I wanna do something freaky to you, baby
So call out my name

They call me me U S H E R R A Y M O N D
Now baby tell me what you wanna do with me
Got a nigga feenin' like Jodeci
Every time that you roll with me, holdin' me
Tryin' to get control of me, nice and slowly
You know, never lettin' go
Never messin' up the flow
This is how the hook go

Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
There ain't no one there to interrupt
Ain't gotta rush
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

See I've been waiting for this for so long
We'll be makin' love until the sun comes up
Baby
I just wanna take it nice and slow
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)

Now tell me
Do you wanna get freaky?
I'll freak you right, I will
I'll freak it, freak it like no one has ever, ever made you feel, yeah
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
(Now baby tell what you wanna do with me)
