Usher: You Make Me Wanna...
-----------------------------

This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do
This is what you do.

Chorus:
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with to
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me.
You make me

Verse 1:
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you
And how you make me wanna...

Chorus:
...Leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me.

Verse 2:
Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you.
What should I do?
Should I tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together.

Chorus:
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you see what you do?
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with oh baby
Start a new relationship with you this is what you do
This is what you do
Think about her ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me.

Verse 3:
At this point the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it
While all of this is going on
I tried
I tried to fight it
But the feelin's just too strong.

Chorus:
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with see what you do?
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with oh baby
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me. (x2)
