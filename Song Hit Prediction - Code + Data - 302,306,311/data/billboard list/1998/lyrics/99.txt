Deborah Cox: Nobody's Supposed To Be Here
-------------------------------------------

How did you get here
Nobody's supposed to be here
I've tried that love thing for the last time
My heart says no, no
Nobody's supposed to be here
But you came along and changed my mind

I've spent all my life
On a search to find
The love who'll stay for eternity
That heaven sent to fulfill my needs
But when I turn around
Again love has knocked me down
My heart got broken
Oh it hurt so bad
I'm sad to say love wins again

So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here

chorus

This time I swear I'm through
But if only you knew
How many times I've said those words
Then fall again, when will I ever learn?
Knowing these tears I've cried
This lovely black butterfly
Must take a chance and spread my wings
Love can make you do some crazy things

So I place my heart under lock and key
To take some time and take care of me
But I turn around and you're standing here
Standing here
No, nobody's supposed to be here

chorus
