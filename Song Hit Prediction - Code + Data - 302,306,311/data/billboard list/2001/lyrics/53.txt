Lil' Mo: Superwoman, Part 2
-----------------------------

(feat. Fabulous)

I guess I ain't got no reason to mingle round
I found a superwoman that can leap from the truck in a single bound
Mammie, I'm tryna bling you down
So niggas without shades on can't stare when I bring you round
She put her lips on the weed and pull it 
Then work her tongue and me cum faster than a speeding bullet
Her love's stronger than a locomotive
But only for the f-a-b-o-l-o-u-s 
sing to me ma

Baby they can't play you
cause I'll save you 
with my super powers
Boy I'm only human 
but I'll be your super woman

They don't know any girls like me no no
Take a girl like me to get a guy like you to understand
How girls and guys sing
I'm not your average chic
Cause they can't do it like this
I've been sent to save your day
And things won't be the same

Baby they can't play you
cause I'll save you 
with my super powers
Boy I'm only human 
but I'll be your super woman

Boy I told you once before
You ain't gotta look up in the sky
Cause the girl you need is right before your eyes
Your so sick of all these broads
Ain't got nothing to stand for
Cause with me you won't fall off no baby ooh

Baby they can't play you
cause I'll save you 
with my super powers
Boy I'm only human 
but I'll be your super woman

Everyday, Everyday
I'll love you in a special way
They can't stay
Now that I'm here, I'm here

It's superwoman bout to save my day
Them co's I hooked and gave some play
Now I wouldn't even wave their way
I understand why them other chics behave that way
They see the icy S on your chest engraved in grey
Be hipped I might
You usually get my tips I'm tight
The only green I keep from you in kryptonite
When that blowing red suit hits your hips so right
It's like de de de de, de de de de de de damn
It's like I'm under your spell
If feelin you is a crime
They gon have to put me under the jail
You probably hear the details that I be in everything
From lairs to CL's to my share of the females but
You know I care for you (care for me)
And anytime this nigga's there for you (there for me)
These feelings I only share for you
This makes it a lil mo clear for you that

Baby they can't play you
cause I'll save you 
with my super powers
Boy I'm only human 
but I'll be your super woman
