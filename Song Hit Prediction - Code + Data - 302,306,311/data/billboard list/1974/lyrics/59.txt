Kool & The Gang: Hollywood Swinging
-------------------------------------

Hey, hey, hey!
Whatcha got to say?
Say hey, hey, hey!
Whatcha got to say?
Hollywood, Hollywood swingin'!
Hollywood, Hollywood swingin'!

I remember
Not too long ago (hey, hey)
I went to a theater
And I saw a Kool and the Gang show
I always wanted to get into a band
To sing my songs
And then become a bad piano playing man
So here I am
In this Hollywood city
The City of the stars, movies, women and cars
Well, I guess I'll
I guess I'll start!

Say hey, hey, hey!
Whatcha got to say?
Say hey, hey, hey!
Whatcha got to say?
Hollywood, Hollywood swingin'!
Hollywood, Hollywood swingin'!

Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging
Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging
Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging
Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging, Hollywood swinging
