The Beau Brummels: Just A Little
----------------------------------

Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... Ahh...

I can't stay, yes I know
You know I hate to go
But goodbye, love was sweet
Our worlds can never meet

So I'll cry just a little cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause I have to go
Away...

Can't you see how I feel
When I say love's unreal
So goodbye, it's been sweet
Even though incomplete

So I'll cry just a little cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause I have to go
Away...

[Instrumental Interlude]

Every night I still hear
All your sighs very clear
Now love's gone, gone away
As I once heard you say

Now I'll cry just a little cause I love you so
And I'll die just a little cause I have to go
Away...

[Instrumental Interlude]

Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... Ahh...
