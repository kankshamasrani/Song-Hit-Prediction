Tom Jones: What's New Pussycat?
---------------------------------

What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh

Pussycat pussycat 
I've got flowers and lots of hours
To spend with you
So go and powder 
Your cute little pussycat nose

Pussycat, pussycat I love you
Yes I do
You and your pussycat nose

What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh

Pussycat, pussycat
You're so thrilling 
And I'm so willing
To care for you
So go and make up 
Your big little pussycat eyes

Pussycat, pussycat, I love you
Yes I do
You and your pussycat eyes

What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What's new, pussycat?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, oh

Pussycat, pussycat 
You're delicious and if my wishes
Can all come true
I'll soon be kissing 
Your sweet little pussycat lips

Pussycat, pussycat, I love you
Yes I do
You and your pussycat lips
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You and your pussycat eyes
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You and your pussycat nose
