The All-American Rejects: Gives You Hell
------------------------------------------

I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place

And you're still probably workin'
At a 9 to 5 pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

Now where's your picket fence love?
And where's that shiny car?
It didn't ever get you far

And you never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

And the truth be told I miss you
And the truth be told I'm lyin'

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell

Tommorow you'll be thinking to yourself:
"Where did I go wrong?"
But the list goes on and on

But the truth be told I miss you
And the truth be told I'm lyin'

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell

When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell

Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well

(When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell)

(When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well
Hope it gives you hell)

When you see my face hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you walk my way hope it gives you hell
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song and you sing along
But you never tell (No, never tell)
Then you're the fool, I just as well
Hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell (It will give you hell)
When you sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell
