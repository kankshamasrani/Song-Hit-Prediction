Smokey Robinson: Cruisin'
---------------------------

Baby let's cruise away from here
Don't be confused baby, the way is clear
And if you want it you got it forever
This is not a one-night stand
Let the music take your mind
And, just release and you will find

You gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruisin together
The music is played for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Baby tonight belongs to us
Everything's right, do what you must
And inch by inch we get closer and closer
To every little part is in touch
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together

Cruise with me baby
Cruise...
Ohhh oooh, cruise with me babe

Oh baby let's cruise
Let's flow, let's glide
Oooh let's open up, and go inside
And if you want it you got it forever
I can just stay there inside you
And love you baby, ohhh
Let the music take your mind
Just release and you will find, baby

You gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruising is made for love
I love it when we're cruisin' together
I love it, I love it, I love it

You gonna fly away, plan to go my way
I love it when we're cruising together
The music is played for love, cruising is made for love
