Chicago: What Kind Of Man Would I Be?
---------------------------------------

Girl, well it's been one of those days again
And it seems like the harder I try
Over and over, I'm right back where I began
But you understand, oh girl

When nothing else in this world goes right
Oh, I just want to run to you,
You'll pull me through, whoa, baby
Who wouldn't want to have you in their life?

Tell me what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

Times when it was pointless for me to try
I was more than a desperate man
What seemed like forever
Was gone with one touch of your hand, oh girl

If I could count all the sleepless nights
When you were there for me
A fool could see, whoa, baby
Once that I found you there was no letting go

Tell me what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

Tell me what kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man would I be?

What kind of man would I be?
Living a life without any meaning
And I know you could surely survive without me
But if I had to live without you
Tell me what kind of man

Tell me what kind of man
Tell me what kind of man would I be? 
(What kind of man would I be?)
Tell me what kind of man would I be?
(What kind of man would I be?)
Tell me what kind of man
