Billy Idol: Cradle Of Love
----------------------------

Well, rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love don't rock easily, it's true

Well, rock the cradle of love
I rocked the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love don't rock easily, it's true
Well, now

It burned like a ball on fire
When the rebel took a little child bride
To tease, yeah, so go easy, yeah

'Cause love cuts a million ways
And shakes the devil when he misbehaves
I ain't nobody's fool
Come on, shake it up
Whatever I do

Rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Yes, the cradle of love don't rock easily, it's true

Sent from Heaven above, that's right
To rock the cradle of love
Yes, the pages of love don't talk decently, it's true

Yeah, flesh for your Romeo
Ah yeah, baby, I hear you moan
It's easy, y'know how to please me, yeah

This love starts my rollin' train
You can't stop it, it ain't in vain
I ain't nobody's fool
Come on, shake it up
Whatever you do

These are the wages of love
Rock the cradle of love
These are the wages of love
Ooh yeah
Rock the cradle
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, oww

Well, it burned like a ball on fire
When the rebel took a little child bride
To tease, yeah, I know how to please you, yeah

Well, my love starts a rollin' train
And you can't stop it, it ain't in vain
I ain't nobody's fool
Come on, shake it up
Whatever I do

Rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Sent from Heaven above
That's right
To rock the cradle of love
Rock the cradle of love
Yeah, cradle of love
That's me mama
I robbed the devil of love (Cradle of love)
All right
Cradle of love
If you tease me, tonight (Rock the cradle of love)
If you sleaze me all right (Cradle of love)
If you appease me tonight (Rock the cradle of love)
And let me ease you (Cradle of love)
Ahh, yeah
Cradle of love
