Steve Lawrence: Go Away Little Girl
-------------------------------------

Go away, little girl, go away, little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you
I know that your lips are sweet
But our lips must never meet
I belong to someone else and I must be true

Oh, go away, little girl, go away, little girl
It's hurtin' me more each minute that you delay
When you are near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So, go away, little girl, before I beg you to stay

[Unverified] go away
[Unverified] please don't stay
[Unverified] it'll never work out

When you are near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So, go away, little girl
Call it a day, little girl

Oh, please, go away, little girl
Before I beg you to stay
Go away
