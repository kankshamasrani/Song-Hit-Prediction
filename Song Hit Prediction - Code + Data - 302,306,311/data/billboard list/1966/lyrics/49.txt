The Standells: Dirty Water
----------------------------

I'm gonna tell you a story
I'm gonna tell you about my town
I'm going to tell you a big fat story, baby
Aw, it's all about my town

Yeah, down by the river
Down by the banks of the river Charles
Aw, that's what's happening, baby
That's where you'll find me
Along with lovers, muggers, and thieves
Aw, but they're cool people

Well, I love that dirty water
Oh, Boston, you're my home
Oh, you're the number one place

Frustrated women
I mean, they're frustrated
Have to be in by twelve o'clock
Oh, that's a shame
But I'm a-wishin' and a-hopin', oh
That just once those doors weren't locked
I like to save time for my baby to walk around

But I love that dirty water
Oh, Boston, you're my home
Oh, yeah

'Cause I love that dirty water
Oh, Boston, you're my home
Oh, yeah

(Well, I love that dirty water) I love it, baby
(I love that dirty water) I love Boston
(I love that dirty water) Have you heard about the Strangler?
(I love that dirty water) I'm the man, I'm the man
(I love that dirty water) Ow
(I love that dirty water) Come on, come on
