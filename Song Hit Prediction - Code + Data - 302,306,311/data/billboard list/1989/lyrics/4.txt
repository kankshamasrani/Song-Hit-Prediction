Paula Abdul: Straight Up
--------------------------

Lost in a dream
I don't know which way to go (Let me say it)
If you are all that you seem
Then baby I'm movin' (movin') way too slow

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
How about some information please?

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh)
Or am I caught in a hit and run?

Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh)
Or are you just having fun?

Time's standin' still
Waiting for some (waitin' for some) small clue
(Let me tell you now)
I keep getting chills
When I think your love (when I think your love) is true

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
How about some information please?

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh)
Or am I caught in a hit and run?

Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh)
Or are you just having fun?

You are so hard to read
You play hide and seek
With your true intentions

If you're only playing games
I'll just have to say
A- b-b-bye bye, b-b-b-b-bye

Do do you love me? (Do do you love me baby?)
Do do you love me? (Do do you love me, hey baby?)
Do do you love me? (Do do you love me, hey baby?) Come on, now!
Do do you love me? (Do do you love me baby?)
Tell me, baby

I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught in the slammin' door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history?

Look, I don't mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information please
(Please, please, please, please, please)

Straight up now tell me (tell me)
Straight up now tell me (tell me)
Straight up now tell me (tell me)
Straight up now tell me
Straight up now tell me

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh)
Or am I caught in a hit and run?

Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh)
Or are you just having fun?

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever (oh oh oh)
Or am I caught in a hit and run?

Straight up now tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together (oh oh oh)
Or are you just having fun?

Straight up now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever
