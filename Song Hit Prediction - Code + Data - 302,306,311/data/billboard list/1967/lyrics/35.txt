Van Morrison: Brown Eyed Girl
-------------------------------

Hey, where did we go?
The days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game

Laughing and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our hearts a-thumpin' and you

My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine
With a transistor radio

Standing in the sunlight, laughing
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall with you

My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da
La te da

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, you have grown

Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes, I'm overcome thinking about
Laughing and running hehe
Behind the stadium with you

My brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha la la la la la la la la la la de da
Sha la la la la la la la la la la de da
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la la la la de da
