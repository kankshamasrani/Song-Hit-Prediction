Mary Jane Girls: In My House
------------------------------

Boy, you can just best believe I'm the only girl in your life;
I'll be your sugar in the morning and the sweet stuff you need at night...
And you can just best believe when it comes down to makin' love,
I'll satisfy your every need and every fantasy you think of...

So when you need a little piece of mind,
Come on over, boy, any time...
I'll keep you happy and so satisfied
In my house, in my house...

So when you need some love and tenderness,
And it's me, baby, that you miss,
Here's the key to unlock the door
To my house, my house...

Ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...

Boy, any time, day or night, when you call me, I will be there;
Just call me up on the phone when you need someone 'round to care...
And when you feel sad and blue, you just come and see me anytime;
I'll kiss away all your tears, and your fears you can leave behind...

So when you need a little piece of mind,
Come on over, boy, any time...
I'll keep you happy and so satisfied
In my house, in my house...

So when you need some love and tenderness,
And it's me, baby, that you miss,
Here's the key to unlock the door
To my house, in my house...

Ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...

Ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...

Ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...

Ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh... (In my house...)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh...
