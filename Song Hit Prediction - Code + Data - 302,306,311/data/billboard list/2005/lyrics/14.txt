Missy Elliott: Lose Control
-----------------------------

[Hot Streak - Body Work Sample]
Music make you lose control,
Music make you lose control.

[Fatman Scoop]
Let's go.
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here we go now, Here we go now, Here we go now, Here we go now.
One time now.
Misdemeanor's in the house.
Ciara's in the house.
Misdemeanor's in the house.
Fatman Scoop, Man Scoop, Man Scoop.

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
I've got a cute face,
Chubby waist,
Thick legs in shape.
Rump shakin' both ways,
Make you do a double-take.
Planet Rocker,
Show stopper,
Flow proper,
Head knocker.
Beat scholar,
Tail dropper.
Do my thang, motherfuckers.

My Rolls Royce,
Lamborghini,
Blue madina,
Always beamin'.
Ragtop,
Chrome pipes,
Blue lights,
Outta sight.

Long weave,
Sow it in.
Say it again,
Sow it in.
Make that money,
Throw it in.
Booty bouncin',
Gon' head.

[Chorus]
Everybody here gettin' out of control,
get your backs off the wall, cause Misdemeanor said so.
Everybody,
Everybody,
Everybody,
Everybody.

[Verse 2: Ciara]
Well my name is Ciara,
for all you fly fellas,
No one can do it better.
(She'll sing on A Cappella)
Boy the music makes me lose control.
(We gon' make ya lose control and let it go, before ya know, you gon' hit the floor)

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I rock to the beat 'til I'm (tired!).
Walk in the club it's (fire!).
Get it crunk and wired.
Wave yo hands, scream (louder!).
If you smoke, then fire it up.
Bring the roof down and (holler!).
If you tipsy, stand up.
DJ, turn it (louder!).

Take somebody by the waist and uh!
Now, throw it in their face like uh!
Hypnotic, robotic, this here will rock your bodies.
Take somebody by the waist and uh!
Now, throw it in their face like uh!
Systematic, it's static. This hit be automatic.

[Breakdown]
(Missy Elliott)
Work me. Work, work.
Work me. Work, work.
Work me. Work, work.
Work me, Do it right.
(Fatman Scoop)
[repeat x6]
Hit the floor. 

[Repeat Chorus x1]

[Fatman Scoop]
Now, put your back on the wall.
Put your back on the wall.
Put your back on the wall.
Put your back on the wall.
Let's go.
Misdemeanor's in the house.
Ciara's in the house.
Misdemeanor's in the house.

[Hot Streak - Body Work Sample]
Music make you lose control.

[Fatman Scoop]
We on fire.
We on fire.
We on fire.
We on fire.
Now, throw it girl.
Throw it girl.
