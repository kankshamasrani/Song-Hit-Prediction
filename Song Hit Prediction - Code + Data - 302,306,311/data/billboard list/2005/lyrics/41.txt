(Baby Blue)
When i grind i make'em say (ahh)
Slow grind be my day job
I grind in the back of my car
Keep it movin like a see-saw
I make'em laugh and giggle
Cuddle a little
Kiss on ya neck, lick your nipples
Like girl let me see that thing jiggle
Girlfriend your body's so raw
I could tell you a superstar
B.l.u.e.s.t.a.r.
I could tell around the block how sexy you are
I drink red bull so i keep stamina
What's my name
What's my name
What's my name
Pretty ricky pretty boy
Doing pretty good thangs
Makng pretty good change
Getting pretty good hits
From these pretty pretty chicks
Getting pretty damn rich
Prettie rickie rickie rickie and the maverix
