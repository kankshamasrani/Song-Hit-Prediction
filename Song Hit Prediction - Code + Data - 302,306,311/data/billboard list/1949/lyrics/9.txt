Frankie Laine: Mule Train
---------------------------

Mule train, (*hyah, hyah*), mule train
Clippity clopping over hill and plain
Seems as how they'll never stop
Clippity clop, clippity clop
Clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity
Clippity clopping along

There's a plug of chaw tobaccy for a rancher in Corona
A guitar for a cowboy way out in Arizona
A dress of calico for a pretty Navajo
Get along mule, get along

Mule train, (*hyah, hyah*), mule train
Clippity clopping over mile and chain
Soon their gonna reach the top
Clippity clop, clippity clop
Clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity
Clippity clopping along

There's some cotton thread and needle
For the folks who's way out yonder
A shovel for a miner who left his home to wander
Some rheumatism pills for the settlers in the hills
Get along mule, get along

Mule train, (*hyah, hyah*), mule train
Clippity clopping through the rain
They'll keep goin' to the top
Clippity clop, clippity clop
Clippity, clippity, clippity, clippity
Clippity clopping along

There's a letter full of sadness
And it's black around the border
A pair of boots for someone
Who had them made to order
A bible in the pack for the Reverend Mr. Black
Get along mule, get along
Get along mule, get along
(Mule train)
