Perry Como: Some Enchanted Evening
------------------------------------

Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger 
you may see a stranger across a crowded room, 
an' somehow you know, you know even then, 
that somewhere you'll see her again and again! 

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing 
you may hear her laughing across a crowded room, 
an' night after night as strange as it seems 
the sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams! 

Who can explain it, who can tell you why, 
fools give you reasons, wise men never try! 

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love 
when you hear her call you across a crowded room, 
then fly to her side and make her your own 
or all thru your life you may dream all alone! 

Once you have found her,  
never let her go! 

Once you have found her,  
never let her go!
