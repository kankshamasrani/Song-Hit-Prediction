Russ Morgan: So Tired
-----------------------

So tired of waiting for you
So tired of longing for you
Tired of waiting
Saving my love for you

So tired of dreaming daydreams
So tired of only play schemes
Why don't you call me
Call me tonight, my dear

Tell me that your thoughts
Are all of me, sweetheart
All day long I wonder
Why we're far apart

So tired of dreaming of you
So tired of waiting for you
But though I'm tired
I'll wait forever, dear

So tired of dreaming of you
So tired of waiting for you
But though I'm tired
I'll wait forever, dear
