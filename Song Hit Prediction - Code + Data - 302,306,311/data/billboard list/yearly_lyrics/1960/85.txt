Ricky Nelson: Young Emotions
------------------------------

Young emotions are mixed emotions
For it's a wold where love and confusion reign
A world of hope and laughter and tears and pain
At times a gentle breezed and a hurricane
A world full of doubt but love works it out

Young emotions and strange emotions
For though we're brave sometimes we are so afraid
But knowing there are memories to be made
We'll face each new tomarrow dear undismayed
For our love will keep us together
And our love will help us to weather
These young emotions

For though we're brave sometimes we are so afraid
But knowing there are memories to be made
We'll face each new tomarrow dear undismayed
For our love will keep us together
And our love will help us to weather
These young emotions.
