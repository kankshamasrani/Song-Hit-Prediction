Bobby Rydell: Little Bitty Girl
---------------------------------

In such a big, big world
Somewhere in this big big world
There's got to be a Little Bitty Girl for me
I've got a big big love
For this Little Bitty Girl
So where in this big big world can she be?

I've searched high and low
In every place I go
I ask everyone I know
Where is this love for me?
I have such big big dreams bout
This Little Bitty Girl
So where in this big big world can she be?

In such a big, big world

There's got to be a Little Bitty Girl for me
