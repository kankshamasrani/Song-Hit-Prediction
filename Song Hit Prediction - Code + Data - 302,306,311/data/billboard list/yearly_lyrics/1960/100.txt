Larry Hall: Sandy
-------------------

Sandy, Sandy
Took every sweet thing, like sugar and spice
Ice cream and candy, everything nice
They put it together, they gave it a name
Sandy, Sandy, I'm a fool for Sandy

Her eyes are like heaven, her lips are divine
Young love is tender, gentle and kind
And everywhere I go, there you will find
Sandy, Sandy, I'm a fool for Sandy

Took every sweet thing, like sugar and spice
Ice cream and candy, everything nice
They put it together, they gave it a name
Oh, Sandy, Sandy, I'm a fool for Sandy

Sandy
Sandy
Sandy
