P!nk: So What
---------------

Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na

I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope)

I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight

Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
I wanna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
I wanna start a fight!

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight

I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Uh, check my flow

The waiter just took my table
And gave it to Jessica Simps' (shit)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit (oops)

What if this song's on the radio
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight

Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
He's gonna start a fight
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na
We're all gonna get in a fight!

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight

I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

You weren't there, you never were
You want it all but that's not fair
I gave you life, I gave my all
You weren't there, you let me fall

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm havin' more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight

I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine (I'm just fine)
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

No no
No no
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight

I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Ba da da da da da, pbbt
