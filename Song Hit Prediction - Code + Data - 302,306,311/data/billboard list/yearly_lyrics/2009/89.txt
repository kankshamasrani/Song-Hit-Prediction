-------------------------

Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time, one time, one time.

When I met you, girl, my heart went knock, knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
And even though it's a struggle love, it's all we got
So we gonna keep, keep climbin' till the mountain top!

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And my heart (I got my)

You're my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)
Im'a tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)
And Im'a be your one guy

You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
Im'a tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)
Im'a tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)

And I'ma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always makin' time for you
Imma tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)
Imma tell you one time (girl, I love, girl, I love you)

You look so deep, You know that it humbles me
You by my side and troubles them don't trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want, shorty, I'll give it to you

Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
And your heart (I got my)

You'll be my one love, my one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
Imma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
And imma be your one guy

You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
Imma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
Imma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

Shawty right there
She's got everything I need and imma tell her one time
Give you everything you need, down to my last dime
She makes me happy, I know where I'll be
Right by your side 'cause she is the one

And girl you're my one love
My one heart, My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)
Imma tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you)

And imma be your one guy
You'll be my number one girl
Always making time for you
Imma tell you one time (one time)
Imma tell you one time (one time)

Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time
Me, plus you. Imma tell you one time, one time, one time.
