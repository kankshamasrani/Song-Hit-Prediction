Jason Aldean: Big Green Tractor
---------------------------------

She had a shiny little beamer with the rag top down
Sittin in the drive, but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barkin and a waggin' around
And I just laughed and said y'all get in

She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
I said whatcha wanna do, baby I don't care
We can go to the show or we can stay right here and

I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

I said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house, or

We can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter

Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor

Just let me dust off the seat...mmm
Now put your pretty little arms around me
Here we go

You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
Oh yeah, yeah

We can go to town
Or we can go another round
On my big green tractor
