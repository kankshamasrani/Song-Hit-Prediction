Vaughn Monroe: How Soon
-------------------------

Vaughn monroe and his orchestra
Vocals by vaughn monroe (vm) and
The moon maids (mm)
(vm) how soon
Will i be seeing you?
How soon
I wish i really knew.
And when will you be saying
Words i want to hear?
Tender little love words
Story old, meaning clear.
How soon
Will i be close to you?
And dance , the way we used to do.
(vm&mm)i see your star eyes gleaming
Don't mind me if i'm dreaming.
(vm) tell me darling now, how soon?
(mm) how soon sweetheart?
(orchestration then;)
(vm&mm)how soon will i be close to you?
And dance, the way we used to do.
(vm) i see your star eyes gleaming
Don't mind me if i'm dreaming.
(vm&mm)tell me darling, now, how soon?
Tell me darling, now, how soon?
