A'me Lorain: Whole Wide World
-------------------------------

I always love a little mystery
But now the tensions killing me
No place left for words to hide
I never thought it could be quite so tough
Lips once sealed are splitting up
There ain't no secrets to outshine, father time

Whispers in the dark don't do, let's hit the lights
Now I just got to spread the news
So what are you telling me? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me? What are you telling me?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I don't have any ifs, I am positive
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Were never gonna be alone, our love is stone

Too many words are too much a crowd
I wanna spill 'em or they'll leak out
I'm so glad to get the chance
I kept it secret till I knew for sure
So not to pick my heart off the floor
Now it's time to take a stand, heart in hand

Whispers in the dark don't do, let's hit the lights
Now I just got to spread the news
So what are you telling me? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me? What are you telling me?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
When I drop a tear you are always here
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I'm look at a living dream, don't wake me up

Don't stop, love me till you drop, it's alright with me
One sharp arrow through the heart, it's alright, it's alright
Now whistle

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I will never give you up
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
You're my one and only love

Whispers in the dark don't do, let's hit the lights
Now I just got to spread the news
So what are you telling me now? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me? What are you telling me?
What are you telling me, now?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I wanna tell the everybody you're my cup of tea
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Your love never shakes, you don't alternate

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Smoke gets in my eyes, I don't see other guys
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Our love will never tumble down, it's built on solid ground
