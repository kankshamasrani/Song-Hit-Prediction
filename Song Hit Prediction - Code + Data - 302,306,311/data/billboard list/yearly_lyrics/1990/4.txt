Bell Biv DeVoe: Poison
------------------------

Poison
[Ron:] Yeah Spyderman & Freeze in full effect
Poison
[Rick:] You ready Ron? [Ron:] I'm ready
[Rick:] You ready Biv? [Biv:] I'm ready, Slick. Are you?
[Rick:] Oh yeah break it down                             

[Biv:]
Girl I must warn you
I sense something strange in my mind
[Ron:]
Situation is serious
Let's cure it 'cause we're running out of time
Mm mm tell 'em Rick
[Rick:]
It's all so beautiful
Relationships they seem from the start
Yeah mm mm 
it's all so deadly
When love is not together from the heart
Mm mm check it out

It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her ([Biv:] wrong move you're dead)
That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and a smile
That girl is poison

[Biv:]
If I were you I'd take precaution
Before I step to meet a fly girl
[Ron:]
You know?
'cause in some portions
You'll think she's the best thing in the world
[Rick:]
She's so fly, she'll drive you right out of your mind
Steal your heart when you're blind
Beware she's schemin', she'll make you think you're dreamin'
You'll fall in love and you'll be screamin' demon ooh

[Ron:]
Poison deadly movin' in slow
Looking for a mellow fellow like DeVoe
Getting paid, laid so better lay low
Schemin' on hearts, money and the whole show
The low pro ho should be cut like an afro
See what you're sayin' huh
She's way into you but I know she's a loser
(How do you know?)
me and the crew used to do her

Poison (x20)

[Biv:]
I was at the park shake thinkin of takin' 'em all
And that night I played the wall
Checkin' out the fellas the highs the lows
Keepin' one eye open still clockin' the ho's
There was one particular girl that stood out from the rest
Poison as can be with a high powered chest
Michael Bivins here and I'm runnin' the show
Bell Biv DeVoe ha-ha ha-ha
Now you know
[Ron:] yo Slick, blow

[Rick:]
It's driving me out of my mind
That's why it's hard for me to find
Can't get it outta my head
Miss her, kiss her, love her [Biv:] wrong move you're dead

That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and a smile
Poison
She's dangerous
Poison
Oh yeah (poison) oh yeah

Yeah fellas that was another dope one 
you hear what I'm saying Mike?
Yeah BBD in full effect.
Yo whassup to Ralph T. and Johnny G. and I cant forget about my boy B. Brown
And the whole NE crew
(Poison)
ah-ha ah-ha ah-ha
