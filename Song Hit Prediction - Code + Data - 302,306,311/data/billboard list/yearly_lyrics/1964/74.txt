The Four Seasons: Ronnie
--------------------------

I'll go on living and keep on forgiving 
Because you were my first love

So very warm and tender (the way you loved me)
Hey girl can't remember (and want more of me)
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie why did you go?
Ronnie, oh Ronnie, Ronnie I am regretting but can't stop forgetting 
Because you were my first love

You said now you don't need me because I cheated
Why didn't you believe me when I repeated
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie you'll never know
Ronnie, oh Ronnie, Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving 
Because you were my first love

I walk alone
I cry at home
Night after night (night after night)
Day after day

(ohh) I never cheated
(ohh) I still repeat it
Ronnie Ronnie Ronnie you'll never know
Ronnie, oh Ronnie Ronnie I'll go on living and keep on forgiving because you were my first love

I'll go on living and keep on forgiving 
Because you were my first love

I'll go on living and keep on forgiving 
Because you were my first love
I'll go on living and keep on forgiving 
Because you were my first love
