Sammy Davis, Jr.: The Shelter Of Your Arms
--------------------------------------------

In this cold world
No matter where I go
The clouds are all the same.
To them I'm just
A pebble in the Sand, a face without a name.

Nobody gives a hang for what I say or do
But you.
And in the shelter of your arms
I find peace and comfort and care.
For I am wanted there.

In this cold world
I struggle to survive
And sometimes I would fall.

You'll think someone
Would lend a helping hand they'd sooner to see me crawl.

Now just when life itself seems more than I can bare, your there.
And in the shelter of your arms,
I find strength and safety in them,
I rise and start again.

Just give me one good reason
To go on living 
To keep on trying.
For what.
I ask you for what.
If not for you and all your love
To see me through.

When times look bad
The shelter of your arms will keep away each fear.
And this cold world
Can never get me down
As long as you are here.

That's why I pray to god
You'll never say goodbye.
And I will know the shelter of your arms
And your love for all of my life.
Until the day I die.
