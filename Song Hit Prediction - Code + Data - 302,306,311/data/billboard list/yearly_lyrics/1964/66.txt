The New Christy Minstrels: Today
----------------------------------

Today, while the blossom still clings to the vine 
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine
And a million tomorrows shall all pass away
Ere I forget all the joys that are mine, today 

Well I'll be a dandy and I'll be a rover
You'll know who I am by the songs that I sing 
I'll feast at your table and lie in your clover
I'll laugh and I'll cry and I'll sing 

Today while the blossom still clings to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries, I'll drink your sweet wine
And a million tomorrows shall all pass away
Ere I forget all the joy that is mine, today

I won't be contented with yesterdays glories 
I can't live on promises winter to spring 
This is my moment and now is my story
Who knows what tomorrow will bring 

Today while the blossom still clings to the vine
I'll taste your strawberries I'll drink your sweet wine
And a million tomorrows shall all pass away
Ere I forget all the joy that is mine, today
