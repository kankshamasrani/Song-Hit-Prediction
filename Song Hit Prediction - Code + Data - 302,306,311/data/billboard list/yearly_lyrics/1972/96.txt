Rick Springfield: Speak To The Sky
------------------------------------

Speak to the sky when ever things go wrong 
and you know you're not talkin' to the air, to the air 
and the world will look better from up there

Speak to the sky 'cause things can get ya down 
and you know when you're talkin' to the Lord, to the Lord 
the world will look better than before

And if I stumble and it seems that I am blind 
or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find 
and though my conversation doesn't always rhyme 
I always try to find some time to .......

Speak to the sky and tell you how I feel 
and to know sometimes what I say ain't right 
It's all right 
cause I speak to the sky every night

And if I stumble and it seems that I am blind 
or if the road I'm on seems awful hard to find 
and though my conversation doesn't always rhyme 
I always try to find some time to .......

Speak to the sky and tell you how I feel 
and to know sometimes what I say ain't right 
It's all right 
cause I speak to the sky every night

Speak to the sky when ever things go wrong 
and you know you're not talkin' to the air, to the air 
and the world will look better from up there
and the world will look better from up there
and the world will look better from up there
