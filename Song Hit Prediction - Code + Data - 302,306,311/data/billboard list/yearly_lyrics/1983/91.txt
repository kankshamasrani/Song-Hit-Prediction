Musical Youth: Pass The Dutchie
---------------------------------

This generation
Rules the nation
With version

Music happens to be the food of love
Sounds to really make you rub and scrub
Dum-a-dum-a-dum-biddly-bum-biddly-bum
Bum-biddly-biddly-biddly-biddly-biddly-biddly-bum
I say

Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side (I say)
Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go done
Give me the music make me jump and prance
It a go done
Give me the music make me rock in and the dance

It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon
(How does it feel when you got no food?)
You could feel it 'cause it was the month of June
(How does it feel when you got no food?)
So I left my gate and went out for a walk
(How does it feel when you got no food?)
As I pass the dreadlocks' camp I heard them say
(How does it feel when you got no food?)

Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side (I say)
Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go done
Give me the music make me jump and prance
It a go done
Give me the music make me rock in and the dance

Bum-bum-biddly-bum-biddly-bum-bum-bum-biddly-bum-biddly-biddly-bum
Yeah

So I stopped to find out what was going on
(How does it feel when you got no food?)
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
(How does it feel when you got no food?)
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing
(How does it feel when you got no food?)
And you could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say
(How does it feel when you got no food?)

Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side (I say)
Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go done
Give me the music make me jump and prance
It a go done
Give me the music make me rock in and the dance

'Cause me say listen to the drummer
Me say listen to the bass
Give me little music
Make me wind up me waist
Me say listen to the drummer
Me say listen to the bass
Give me little music
Make me wind up me waist

I say
Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side (I say)
Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go done
Give me the music make me jump and prance
It a go done
Give me the music make me rock in and the dance

You play it on the radio
A so me say
We a go hear it on the stereo
A so me know
We a go play it on the disco
A so me say
We a go hear it on the stereo
Oh!

Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side (I say)
Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side
It a go done
Give me the music make me jump and prance
It a go done
Give me the music make me rock in and the dance

On the left hand side (I say)
On the left hand side (I say)
On the left hand side
On the left hand side
On the left hand side 
Well, me say East, say West
(On the left hand side) Say North and South
This is gonna really make us (On the left hand side) jump and shout
Well, me say East, say West
(On the left hand side) Say North and South
(This is gonna really make us jump and shout) Pass the dutchie 'pon the left hand side
