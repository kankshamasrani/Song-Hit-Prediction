The Human League: (Keep Feeling) Fascination
----------------------------------------------

If it seems a little time is needed
Decisions to be made (Hey, hey-ey-ey, hey)
The good advice of friends unheeded
The best of plans mislaid

Just looking for a new direction
In an old familiar way (Hey, hey-ey-ey, hey)
The forming of a new connection
To study or to play

And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

Well, the truth may need some re-arranging
Stories to be told (Hey, hey-ey-ey, hey)
And plain to see the facts are changing
No meaning left to hold

And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on
