Joe Tex: Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Three nights ago I was at a disco
Man, I wanted to bump, I was rarin' to go
And this big fat woman, bumped me on the floor
She was rarin' to go, that chick was rarin' to go
Man, she did a dip, almost broke my hip
She was gettin' down, that chick was gettin' down
She wanted to bump some more, but I told her, No
You done knocked me down once, you done knocked me down once
Said, if you want to dance, find you a big fat man
Ya'll both can get on down, ya'll both can get on down, huh

I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
Lord, I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman

Somebody take her
She's too big for me
She'll knock me down

She came over to me, snatched me out of my seat
She wanted to get on down, still wanted to get on down
I told her to go on and leave me alone
I ain't gettin' down, you done hurt my hip once
I know what you'll do, I ain't gonna bump with you
I don't feel like gettin' down, don't feel like gettin' down
She just shook her head at every word I said
She wanted to get on down, that woman wanted get on down
She did that dip again, and I hit the floor again
She was gettin' down, Lord, that woman was gettin' down

I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
Lord, I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman
I ain't gonna bump no more with no big fat woman

Somebody take her, I don't want her
She done hurt my hip, she done knocked me down
Done hurt my hip, she done knocked me down
Somebody take her, I don't want her
Say, Leroy, you can have this one, dude
This big fat woman, dude
I don't want her
