Climax Blues Band: Couldn't Get It Right
------------------------------------------

Time was driftin', this rock had got to roll
So I hit the road and made my getaway
Restless feeling really got a hold
I started searching for a better way

And I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right
I couldn't get it right

L.A. fever made me feel right
But I must admit it got the best of me
Getting down, so deep I coulda drowned
I can't get back the way I used to be

But I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right
Couldn't get it right

New York City took me with the tide
But I nearly died from hospitality
Left me stranded, took away my pride
Just another no-account fatality

I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right
Couldn't get it right

I kept on looking for a sign in the middle of the night
But I couldn't see the light
No, I couldn't see the light
I kept on looking for a way to take me through the night
Couldn't get it right
Couldn't get it right
