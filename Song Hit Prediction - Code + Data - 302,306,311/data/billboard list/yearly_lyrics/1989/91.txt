Alice Cooper: Poison
----------------------

Your cruel deep eyes
Your blood, like ice
One look could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (Don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (Too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (And pins)
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't wanna touch you, but you're under my skin (Deep in)
I wanna kiss you, but your lips are venomous poison 
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

One look (One look) could kill (Could kill)
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (Don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (Too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison 
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison, I don't wanna break these chains
Poison (Poison)

I wanna love you, but I better not touch (Don't touch)
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you, but I want it too much (Too much)
I wanna taste you, but your lips are venomous poison 

Yeaah!
I don't wanna break these chains, poison (Poison)
Burning deep inside my veins
Burning deep (Poison) inside my veins, poison (Poison)
I don't wanna (Poison) break these chains
(Poison) Poison
