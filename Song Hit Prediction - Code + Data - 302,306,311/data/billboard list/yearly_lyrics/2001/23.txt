Destiny's Child: Survivor
---------------------------

Now I let you out of my life I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you sold 9 million

I'm a survivor I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor I'm gonna make it
I will survive keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor I'm gonna make it

Thought I couldn't breathe without you I'm inhaling
You thought I couldn't see without you perfect vision
You thought I couldn't last without you but I'm lastin'
You thought that I would die without you but I'm livin'
Thought that I would fail without you but I'm on top
Thought it would be over by now but it won't stop
Thought that I would self-destruct but I'm still here
Even in my years to come I'm still gon' be here

I'm a survivor I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor I'm gonna make it
I will survive keep on survivin'

I'm a survivor I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor I'm gonna make it

I'm wishin' you the best pray that you are blessed
Much success, no stress, and lots of happiness (I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' blast you on the radio (I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' lie on you and your family, yo (I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' hate on you in the magazines (I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' compromise my Christianity (I'm better than that)
