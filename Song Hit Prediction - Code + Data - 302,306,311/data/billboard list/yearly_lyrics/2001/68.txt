112: It's Over Now
--------------------

What is this numbers in your pocket
I remember when you used to throw those things away
Why do you want to keep in touch now
Who gave you a reason to act so shady

Baby you know you can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
Ooh, that's how much I care for you
Wanna act now never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone girl you know that ain't cool
Yes, I don't understand baby

Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought we'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now, it's over now

You think that I don't know what's going on
Cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
'Cause you can't even face me
I know you're messing around

Baby you know you can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you
Wanna act now never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone girl you know that ain't cool
Ohh, I don't understand baby

Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought we'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now, it's over now
Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought we'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now, it's over now

Baby it's a shame
Shame that we go through
Things that we go through
When you're in love with me and I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk
Talk about our problems
Instead of running away
Ohh baby it's a shame we couldn't work it out
Forgot what love was all about
And our feelings we had from the start
My heart will always be with you

Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought we'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now, it's over now
Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought we'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now, it's over now
Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought we'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now, it's over now
