Mariah Carey: Loverboy
------------------------

I got myself a lover
Who loves what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

He's all mine
And his lovin' makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

Loverboy come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you knows how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long, babe

Got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
He's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
'Cause when my sugar daddy
Take me for a ride
Whatever way we go
It's delirium time

I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be
My loverboy

Loverboy come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you knows how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long, babe

This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you
(Yes I do)
'Cause you affect me, fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
Whoo
My thoughts flow in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you
Candy
Simply put, you're the reason why
Even though I'm real shy
It's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you
(Indeed I do)

Loverboy come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you knows how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long, babe

Loverboy come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you knows how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long, babe

Loverboy come on and love me
Give me more
Touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me
All night long
Loverboy come on and take me
Only you knows how to make me
Shudder with anticipation
All night long, babe

Like strawberry
Rasberry
All those good things
Diamonds and gumdrops
That what you seem to me
