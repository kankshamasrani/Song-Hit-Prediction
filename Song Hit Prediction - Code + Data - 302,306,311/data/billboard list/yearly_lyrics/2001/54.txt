Evan And Jaron: Crazy For This Girl
-------------------------------------

She rolls the window down,
And she talks over the sound
Of the cars that pass us by,
& I don't know why,
But she's changed my mind.

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly,
But she don't know how I feel,
And as she carries on without a doubt,
I wonder if she's figured out,
I'm crazy for this girl.

She was the one to hold me, 
The night the sky fell down,
And what was I thinkin' when,
the world didn't end?
Why didn't I know what I know now?

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly,
But she don't know how I feel,
And as she carries on without a doubt,
I wonder if she's figured out,
I'm crazy for this girl.

I'm crazy for this girl,
And right now,
Face to face, all my fears,
Pushed aside and right now,
I'm ready to spend,
the rest of my life with you.

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly,
But she don't know how I feel,
And as she carries on without a doubt,
I wonder if she's figured out,
I'm crazy for this girl.
I'm crazy for this girl...

Would you look at her as she looks at me?
She's got me thinkin' about her constantly,
But she don't know how I feel,
And as she carries on without a doubt,
I wonder if she's figured out,
I'm crazy for this girl.
Yeah, I'm crazy for this girl.
