Could it be my baggy jeans
Or my gold teeth
That make me different from y'all

But listen dog

I'm just doin' my thing
These are my ghetto slang
And I'm representin' thug shit
This who I roll with
Watch them niggas that's gon' love this
Niggas who out on bond
On the run
Got 10 years on parole
Since you can't say it dog I'm a say it for y'all

Fuck the judge & CEO's
Fuck the DA & PO's
Fuck the family of the victim
Witness that's snitchin' ass hoes nigga.

And some zephanyll
And I'm like fuck it dog
As long as my extasy got the best of me
And none of you niggas ain't stressin' me
I got one request in this bitch
And you can have the rest of this shit
If a nigga drop some shit
It's whack as hell
And don't make no damn sense
Take it back
Talk about it
And tell your dog don't even buy that shit
And I don't care who he is
Or where he from

And you ain't gotta give me my props
Or nominate me
'Cause damn it I love this.
