Bill Anderson: Still
----------------------

(Still) though you broke my heart
(Still) though we're far apart
I love you still
(Still) after all this time
(Still) you're still on my mind
I love you still

I've lost count of the hours 
And I've lost track of the days  
In fact, I've lost just about everything 
Since you went away  
Everything, that is, except the memories you left me
And that's one thing that no one can mar  

I don't know who you're with 
I don't even know where you've gone  
My only hope is that some day you might hear this song 
And you'll know that I wrote it especially for you  
And I love you, wherever you are

(Still) after all this time
(Still) you're still on my mind
I love you still

This flame in my heart is like an eternal fire 
For every day it burns hotter 
And every day it burns higher  
And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker 
Not even with all of these tears  

My friends think I'm crazy and maybe I am  
But I'll carry this torch just as long as I can 
For some day, you might just decide to come home 
And I want you to know   
I'm still here

(Still) though you broke my heart
(Still) though we're far apart
I love you still
