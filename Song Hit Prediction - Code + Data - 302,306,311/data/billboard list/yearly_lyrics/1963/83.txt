Lesley Gore: Judy's Turn To Cry
---------------------------------

Cause now it's judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause johnny's come back
To me
Aww when judy left with johnny at my party(my party)
And came back wearing his ring
I sat down and cried my eyes
Now that was a foolish thing
Cause now it's judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause johnny's come back
To me
Well it hurt me so to see them dance together
I felt like making a scene
My tears just felt like rain drops
Cause judy's smile was so meen
Cause now it's judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause johnny's come back
To me
Oh one night I saw them kissing at a party
So I kissed some other guy
Johnny got up and hit him
Cause he still loved me that's why
Cause now it's judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause johnny's come back
To me
Yay now it's judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Judy's turn to cry
Cause johnny's come back
To me
