The Four Seasons: Candy Girl
------------------------------

I've been a-searching all this big wide world
Now finally I found my
Candy girl, candy girl

I found me a girl (Candy girl)
She sets my heart a-whirl (Candy girl)
With huggin' (huggin') and kissin' (kissin') and lovin'
She's mine (mine) mine (mine)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Candy girl

We get along so well (Candy girl)
I know just why I fell (Candy girl)
She's thrillin' (thrillin') oh, chillin' (chillin') yeah, she's so divine
She's mine (mine) mine (mine)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Candy girl

When we're out together
Everyone knows the way we feel
We both seem to glow with a glow of love
And it's plain to see
Our love is real

I'm happy as can be (Candy girl)
She vows eternally (Candy girl)
To hold me (hold me) and love me (love me) until the end of time
She's mine (mine) mine (mine)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Candy girl
Candy girl
Candy girl
Candy girl
Candy girl
Candy girl
Candy girl
