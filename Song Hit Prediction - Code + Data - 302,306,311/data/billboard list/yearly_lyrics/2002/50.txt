Big Tymers: Still Fly
-----------------------

(Baby (Talking)
Whassup Fresh? It's our turn, baby?

(Chorus: Mannie Fresh)
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits (With Da Gucci Suits)
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp (Ehh-Ehh Ehh-Ehh, I Stay sharp)
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent (Mmm-Hmm)
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly (Uh,Uh, (beep) Cause I'm So Fly)
Got a quarter tank a gas in my new E-Class(In my E-Class Benz)
Bt thats alrght cuz im gonna ride
Got everything in my momma name 
But I'm hood rich la da da daa
(Baby)
Get your  *cuh-ck-cuh-cuh* car play gems gone shine
Instead momma get a bling - baby girl let's ride (Let's Ride)
You a number one stunna, and we gon' glide
And go straight to the mall and tear down the inside
Do that Prada, Gucci, full length leather
Bourbon's cool or Coogi sweater (Sweater)
Twenty-inches pop my feather - the Birdman daddy I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is So Fly
Number one don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars I am that (beep)
The *cuh-ck-cuh-cuh* Coogi with a matching interior
Three wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and Stunner and we like brothas
We shine like paint daddy - it's our Summer

(Chorus: Mannie Fresh)
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shy
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly
Got a quarter tank a gas in my new E-Class
Bt thats alrght cuz im gonna ride
Got everything in my momma name 
But I'm hood rich la da da daa

(Mannie Fresh)
Have you ever seen a crocodile seats in the truck
Turn around sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steering wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma - player, is where you can find me
Cruisin through the parking lot on twenty fours
(Coming Through The Hood On 'Em Twenty Fo's)
Cadillac Esclade with the chromed out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot
Where your wife really lonely cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the three wheel Benz (Skiiiiiirt!)
Hyper white lights, ultra Violet LEDs
Suma-tuma tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the Horn go (Ugh-Ughh)- boy you count that
I'ma show you some (beep) - rookie press that butt'
The trunk went (Ehh-Ehh) and all of a sudden
Four fifteen's - didn't see no wires
Then I heard (Boom!) from the amplifiers

(Chorus: Mannie Fresh)
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shy
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly
Got a quarter tank a gas in my new E-Class
Bt thats alrght cuz im gonna ride
Got everything in my momma name 
But I'm hood rich la da da da daa

(Baby)
(ay ay ay)
Lemme slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impalla loud pipes - Drinkin the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man - I'll do it again
In a Cadillac Trucks twenty fo's with tens

(Mannie Fresh)
Looking at my Gucci  it's about that time
Six bad broads flying in that nine
New Suburban Truck with the porno showing
Up and down {*orgasm*} and up they goin'

(Baby)
Bodies on the Roadster  Lexus you know what?
That hard-top beamer (ay, ay) Ma', that's your truck
I come in up the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to Bubbly (Bubbly)

(Mannie Fresh)
Four-thirty Lex with the convertable top
And the rims keeps spinning everytime I stop
Got a superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a Ol' School Caddy with the (diamond in the back)

(Chorus: Mannie Fresh)
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shy
Can't pay my rent, cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm Still Fly
Got a quarter tank a gas in my new E-Class
Bt thats alrght cuz im gonna ride
Got everything in my momma name 
But I'm hood rich la da da da daa
