The Turtles: You Showed Me
----------------------------

You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you 
Ohhhhh, it's true
Ohhhhh, I love you

You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
Ohhhhh, it's true
You fell for me too

And when I tried it
I could see you fall
And I decided
It's not a trip at all

You taught it to me to
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too
Ohhhh, it's true
We're in love, we two

Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
We're in love, we two
We two

You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you 
You showed me how to say
Exactly what you say
In that very special way
You taught it to me to
Exactly what you do
And now you love me too (repeat to fade)
