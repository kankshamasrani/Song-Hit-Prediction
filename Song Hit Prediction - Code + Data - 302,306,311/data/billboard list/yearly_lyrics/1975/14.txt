Carl Douglas: Kung Fu Fighting
--------------------------------

Ohohoho
Ohohoho
Ohohoho
Ohohoho

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they fought with expert timing

There were funky Chinamen from funky Chinatown
They were chopping them up, they were chopping them down
It's an ancient Chinese art and everybody knew their part
From a feint into a slip and a kicking from the hip

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening, yeah, yeah
But they fought with expert timing

There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung
He said: "Here comes the big boss" (Where? Where?), "Let's get it on"
We took a bow and made a stand, started swaying with the hand
The sudden motion made me skip, now we're into a brand new trick

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
But they did it with expert timing

Oh yeah

Ohohoho (Hu!)
Ohohoho (Ha!)
Ohohoho (Hu!)
Ohohoho (Ha!)

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Sure enough

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightening
Make sure you have expert timing

Kung fu fighting
Had to be fast as lightning

Ohohoho (Hu!)
Ohohoho (Ha!)
Ohohoho (Hu!)
Ohohoho (Ha!)

Keep on, keep on, keep on
Yeah, yeah

Everybody was kung fu fighting
