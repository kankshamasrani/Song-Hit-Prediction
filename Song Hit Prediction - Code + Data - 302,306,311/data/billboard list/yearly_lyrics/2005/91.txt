O...Let me tell you girl
Woa, oh, oh, o... hey, here I go, here I go

I know you heard EM say it
time and time again
that they would ROCK your world 
And change your life
But I can't blame them 
Cause you make a nigga wanna get involved
Wanna get dem draws
Well I'm gone put my bit in
to get at u
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do 
The only difference is 
they look out for themselves
But I'm doin' it, just to hear you yell, yeah

[Chorus]
O...that's gunna be the sound
Girl when its goin' down
Your body sayin O... (O, o, oh)
Don't have to say my name, 
Girl I'm just glad you came
So you can say O...(in the morning)
O...(in the night)
you saying O means
O is hittin it right
Ooo, Ooo, Ooo...
You can't be mad at me 
I'm just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream O...

[Verse 2]
Girl come on over 
And let's get this thing crackin
You'll be surprised 
when you see what's O's unpackin
Cause I'm young but I'm ready
Trynna get hot and heavy
Turn you out if you let me in
Yeah, yeah 
Girl I'm gone take you somewhere 
that you never been 
Show you some things that'll
make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you can't even say a thing
But that's okay all you gotta say is

[Chorus]
O...(Ooo, O, O, Oooo) that's gunna be the sound
Girl when its goin' down
Your body sayin O... (O, o, oh)
Don't have to say my name, 
Girl I'm just glad you came
So you can say O...(in the morning)

Ooo, Ooo, Ooo...
You can't be mad at me 
I'm just aiming to please
Let me hear you scream O...

[Hook]
O is for that overtime I'm puttin in
We'll go for hours take a break 
and go at it again
Girl I work my way from A
all the way to Z
But trust me baby girl
O is where you wanna be
Girl believe me when I tell you
I'm not tryna tell you what to do
Cause when its said and done
The choice ain't mine it's really up to you
Just say yes, don't fix your mouth to tell me no
Drop that bottom JAW for me and just say Ooooooooooooo............ O, O,Oh, O, O

So you can say O...(in the morning)
