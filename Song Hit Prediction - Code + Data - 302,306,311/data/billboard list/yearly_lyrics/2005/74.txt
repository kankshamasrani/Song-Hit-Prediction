Pretty Ricky: Your Body
-------------------------

Yes sir
Yes sir
Yes sir
Yes sir

[Chorus]
I got new shoes on right(yes sir)
Rollin' down 95 (yes sir)
And you can see it in my eyes (yes sir)
That I'm lookin for a cutiepie (yes sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes sir)
And we can just cuddle up (yes sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (yes sir)
Then damn it ill beat it up(yes sir)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)

[Baby Blue]
I don't know why, but the ladies call ol' baby blue the sticker
They take me and rape me and make me they victim 
I lick them and freak them and if they married I sneak them
If they look like girlfriend material, then I keep 'em 
Stuntin' through the city tryin' to find a lady who's
Beautiful, but she gotta have booty too 
Baby blue gonna let you do what you wanna do 
You can feel on it if you really want to
Get a taste of this salami
knock knock knock knock you down like a tsunami
Bussin you like a tummy
I'mma ahead of my class
Gettin head in this Jag
Look in this duffle bag see benjemin head on the cash
[Chorus]
I got new shoes on right (yes sir)
Rollin' down 95 (yes sir)
And you can see it in my eyes (yes sir)
That I'm lookin for a cutiepie (yes sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes sir)
And we can just cuddle up (yes sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (yes sir)
Then damn it imma beat it up(yes sir)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)

Top down blue star tag 
Ol' master bear skin rugs in the jag
Spectac with the bad chick in the back 
tryin to beat it up like an Everlast punching bag
hotter than a bisquick biscuit out the oven 
your baby mama go on missions to get this lovin
we kissin and huggin she never pick her phone up
You be lookin for her while we doin the grown up
she complain when she catch back spasms, But she love when she catch the back orgasms
yes sir, the game is automatic, give it to 'em one time
They come back like addicts.

[Chorus]
I got new shoes on right(yes sir)
Rollin' down 95 (yes sir)
And you can see it in my eyes (yes sir)
That I'm lookin for a cutiepie (yes sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes sir)
And we can just cuddle up (yes sir)
But if she want me to beat it up(yes sir)
Then damn it ill beat it up (yes sir)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)

[Slick 'Em]
Well let me step up in this thang 
Right lookin smellin good
lookin good Spec and Baby Blue and Pleasure Fool
That's all we got!
let me drop my top pull up in the parking lot
grab a grape soda bag of chips
that's all I got
park outside minglin wit' my homeboys
faked out fake hugs leave me alone boy 
plus the candy lookin good enough to eat 
you can tell by the way the girls actin cross the street
but on the other hand
Alfalfa Just hit me on my metro 
say a party in the park hard baby let's go
the balla-tic no questions asked, so I jumped out the white jag 
smooth like Shaft come here girl!

I got new shoes on the right (yes sir)
Rollin' down 95 (yes sir)
And you can see it in my eyes (yes sir)
That I'm lookin for a cutiepie (yes sir)
And we ain't gotta make love (yes sir)
And we can just cuddle up (yes sir)
But if she want me to beat it up (yes sir)
Then damn it ill beat it up(yes sir)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
My body, your body (it's burnin' up)
