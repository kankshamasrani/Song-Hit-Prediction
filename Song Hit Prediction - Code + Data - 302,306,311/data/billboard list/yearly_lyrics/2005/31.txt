Gwen Stefani: Rich Girl
-------------------------

Gwen Stefani:
Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na

Eve:
Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls
What, it's all love
What, give it up, what
(Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter) What

Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls
What, it's all love
What, give it up, what
(Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter) What

Gwen Stefani:
If I was a rich girl, na na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na na na
See, I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never, ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl

Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown
No, wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to my fancy house in London town

All the riches baby, won't mean anything
All the riches baby, won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other, baby
Your lovin' is better than gold, and I know

If I was a rich girl, na, na, na, na, na
See, I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never, ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl

I'd get me four Harajuku girls to (Uh huh)
Inspire me and they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names, yeah
Love, angel, music, baby
Hurry up and come and save me

All the riches, baby won't mean anything
All the riches, baby won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby won't mean anything
Don't need no other, baby
Your lovin' is better than gold, and I know

Eve:
Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls
What, it's all love
What, give it up, what
(Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter) What

Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls
What, it's all love
What, give it up, what
(Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter)

What happened to my life
Turned upside down
Chicks that blew ya mind
Ding, it's the second round

Original track ending, mmm
You know you can't buy these things (No)
See Stefani and her L.A.M.B.
I rock the Fetish, people, you know who I am

Gwen Stefani:
Yes ma'am, we got the style that's wicked
I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't gettin' nothin' but love

If I was a rich girl, na na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na na na
See, I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never, ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl

Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
