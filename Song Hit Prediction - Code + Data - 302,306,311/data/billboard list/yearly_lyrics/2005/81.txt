The Black Eyed Peas: Don't Lie
--------------------------------

Fergie
La la la la la la

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

will.i.am
Hey baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growin when I be telling the fibs now
You said your trust is getting weaker
Prolly cuz my lies just started getting deeper
And the reason for my confession
Is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated
And I lied a little more
But after what you did
I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I've been a little immature
Fucked with your heart
Like I was the predator
In my book of lies
I was the editor
And the author
I forged my signature
And I apologize for what I did to ya
Cuz what you did to me I did to you

Fergie
No no no no baby
No no no no don't lie
Cuz ya know know know know
Yeah ya know know know know you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out
When I'm here to see you
And what you're all about
No no no no baby
No no no no dont lie
Cos you know you know you know you know you know you gotta try
Stop st-stop stop st-stop stop lyin

apl.de.ap
She said I'm leaving
She can't take the pain
Its hard to continue
This love it aint the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
To many lies commited to many gains
She feeling like a fool
Getting on the last train
Tryin to maintain
But the feeling won't change
Im sorry for the thing that ive done
And what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Surrounded by lights, cameras you know the fame
I dont know the reason why I did these things
Oooooh and I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained

Fergoe
And I lie and I lie
And a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained

No no no no baby
No no no no don't lie (no don't you lie)
Cos ya know know know know
Yeah ya know know know know you gotta try
What ya gonna do when it all comes out
When I'm here to see you
And what you're all about
No no no no baby
No no no no don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know, you know you gotta try

(Hoohoohoohoo hoohoohoo repeated 12 x
Badabada repeated 8 x)

Taboo
Yo I'm lying to my girl
Even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention
And diamonds and pearls
She the one who makes me feel
On top of the world
Still I'm lying to my girl I do it
And I lie and I lie and I lie and then I lie
Till there's no turning back

Fergie
I don't know why I lie and I lie
Till I don't know who I am
Then I tell myself

No no no no baby
No no no no don't lie (Don't you lie!)
Cos ya know know know know
Yeah ya know know know know you gotta try (you know you know you gotta)
What ya gonna do when it all comes out
When I'm here to see you
And what you're all about
No no no no baby
No no no no don't lie
No no no no baby
No no no no
Stop st-stop stop st-stop stop lyin'
