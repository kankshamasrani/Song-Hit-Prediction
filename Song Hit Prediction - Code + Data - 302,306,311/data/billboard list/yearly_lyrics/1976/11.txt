Hall & Oates: Sara Smile
--------------------------

Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you're watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight
When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on, you come and hold me
It's you, and me, forever

Sara, smile
Won't you smile a while for me, Sara?

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?
If you want to be free, you know, all you got to do is say so
And when you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on, I'll come and hold you
It's you, and me, forever

Sara, smile
Won't you smile a while for me?
