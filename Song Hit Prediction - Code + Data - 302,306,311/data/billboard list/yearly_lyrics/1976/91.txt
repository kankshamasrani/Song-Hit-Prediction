Bay City Rollers: Money, Honey
--------------------------------

Money, can't make you turn your head now.
Money, can't get you into bed now.
Money, Honey - Can't give more than you get now.

Money, Honey - you ain't got no respect
Snide like a fox, yea, just to see what you can get
And Money Honey get your breakfast in bed
Hey Money Honey, oh you drive me out of my head.

Living - like a princess with a frown
Giving - I can't afford a crown.
Money - Honey - Hey girl come on don't bring me down

Money, Honey - you ain't got no respect
Snide like a fox, yea, just to see what you can get
And Money Honey get your breakfast in bed
Hey Money Honey, oh you drive me out of my head.

Money - must it buy all I get now.
Money - without how far would I get now
Money, Money, Money, Money - Honey
Without it you'd be losing my respect now.
