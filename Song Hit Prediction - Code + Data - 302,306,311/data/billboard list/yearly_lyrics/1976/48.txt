Chicago: If You Leave Me Now
------------------------------

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooohooohooo, no, baby please don't go

And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
Ooohooohooo, no, baby please don't go
Ooohooohooo, girl, I just want you to stay

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away?
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret
The things we said today

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooohooohooo, no, baby please don't go

Ooohooohooo, girl, I just got to have you by my side

Ooohooohooo, no, baby please don't go

Ooohooo, mama, I just got to have your lovin' here
