Lloyd: Get It Shawty
----------------------

This is a...
Track track track man

I guess I can let this woman slip away
'cause I got my eye on you
I see you lookin' over your shoulder
Let me make my way over
Excuse me miss lady, how you doin'?
Your body lookin' right
You're the type I like and I'm pursuin'
Can I get a little closer?
So I can get to know you and exchange names and things
Before the night is over

All I really want is
For you to back it up
Go on and put your weight on it
'cause it's alright
Do what you wanna
Make me believe you
I wanna see you

Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty

I guess if I can let the night just drift away
So baby what you gon' do?
'cause I don't wanna lose it
Come on keep it movin'
Excuse me miss lady, how you doin'
Your body lookin' right,
You're the type I like and I'm pursuin'
Can I get a little closer?
So I can get to know you and exchange names and things
Before the night is over

All I really want is
For you to back it up
Go on and put your weight on it


'cause it's alright
Do what you wanna
Make me believe you
I wanna see you

Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty

(Yung Joc:)
Ey ey shimmy shimmy coco puff
You should get to know Joc
I pull up and that hard top
I bet I make your heart stop
The life I lead
I pop the trunk
I can buy you gifts
When they wanna hate
Oh shawty won't you slide with me
Cl5 50
Inhale the freshness the essence of leather wood jumping
It's gonna be a late night
I'mma show you what I taste like
Love's got no break lights
Jaws like a great white

All I really want is
For you to back it up
Go on and put your weight on it
'cause it's alright
Do what you wanna
Make me believe you
I wanna see you

Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
Get it shawty
