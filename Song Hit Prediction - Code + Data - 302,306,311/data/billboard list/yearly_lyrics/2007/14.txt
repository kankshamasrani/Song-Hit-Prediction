[Chorus]
Party like a rock

[Verse 1]
I'm on a money makin' mission, but I Party Like A Rock Star
I'm flyin' down 20 lookin' good in my hot car
You know them hoes be at my show grabbin' where my chain go
I got a rubber in my pants, but these hoes won't let my thing go

I do it like I do it
'Cause you know them hoes be tryin' that
Oh, don't you know I fuck with fine diamonds that look like Pamela?

They fine & they hot, bro
When I'm in the spot, bro
I Party Like A Rock Star!

[Chorus]
Party like a rock

[Verse 2]
Party like a rock star
Do it wit' the black & the white like a cop car
Whoop, whoop!
Me & my band, man
On the yacht with Marilyn Manson gettin' a tan man

You know me, with a skull belt & wallet chain
Shop Boyz, rock stars
Yeah we 'about to change the game

Change the game? Uh-oh! They know that I'm a star
I make it rain from the center of my guitar

[Chorus]
Party like a rock
Party like a rock star
Party like a rock
Party like a rock star
Party like a rock

[Verse 3]
As soon I came out the womb my mama knew a star was born
Now I'm on the golf course trippin' wit' the Osbourne's
I seen the show wit' Travis barker
Rockstar Mentality
I'm jumpin' in the crowd just to see if they would carry me

Bitches wanna marry me, they see me they just might panic
My ice make 'em go down quick like the Titanic!
Yeah, I'm wit' the Shop Boyz, you know what we do
I'm surfin' screamin' 'cowabunga'
Totally dude!

[Chorus]
Party like a rock
Party like a rock star
