Ciara: Like A Boy
-------------------

2007...
Ladies, I think it's time to switch roles.

C I A R A.

Pull up your pants 
Just Like It
Take out the trash 
Just Like It
Gettin' your cash like em' 
Fast like em' 
Girl you oughta act like ya dig 
I'm talkin' bout'
Security codes on everything 
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring 
Have a Joint Account
And another one he don't know about 

I wish we could switch up the roles 
And I could be that... 
Tell you I love you 
But when you call I never get back 
Would you ask them questions like me?... 
Like where you be at? 
Cause I'm out 4:00 in the morning 
On the corner rollin'
Doin' my own thing 
Ohh 
 
What if I
Had a thing on the side
Made you cry? 
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy 

Can't be gettin mad
What You Mad? 
Can't Handle that?
Can't be gettin mad
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?

I wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that...

Go head and be... 
Just Like It
Go run the streets 
Just Like It
Come home just to sleep like em' 
Creep like em' 
Front with your friends 
Act hard when you're with em' like em' 
Keep a straight face when you tell a lie 
Always keep an airtight alibi
Keep 'Em In The Dark
What he don't know won't break his heart 

I wish we could switch up the roles 
And I could be that... 
Tell you I love you...

(heart beating)

But when you call I never get back 
Would you ask them questions like me?... 
Like where you be at? 
Cause I'm out 4:00 in the morning 
On the corner rollin'
Doin' my own thing 
Yeah

What if I
Had a thing on the side what if I made you cry? 
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy 

Can't be gettin mad.
What You Mad
Can't Handle that?
Can't be gettin mad
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?
You can't be gettin mad
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?
Can't be gettin mad?
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?

If I was always gone 
With the sun gettin home 
Would You Like That?
Told you I was with my crew 
When I knew it was true 
Would You Like That?
If I act like you 
Walk a mile off in your shoes 
Would You Like That?
I'm messin' with your head again 
Dose of your own medicine

Oh oh
Oh oh

C I A R A

Come on

Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride
Ladies and gentlemen, let's ride

If I played you... 
Would you like that? 
Had friends... 
Would you like that? 
Never call... 
Would you like that? 
Aw naw 
You wouldn't like that 
No...

What you mad
Can't handle that
Why you gettin' mad
What you mad
Can't handle that

What if I
Had a thing on the side
Made you cry?
Would the rules change up or would they still apply?
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy 

Can't be gettin mad?
What You Mad? 
Can't Handle that?
Can't be gettin mad?
What you mad?
Can't handle that?
You can't be gettin mad?
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?
Can't be gettin' mad?
What you mad? 
Can't handle that?
