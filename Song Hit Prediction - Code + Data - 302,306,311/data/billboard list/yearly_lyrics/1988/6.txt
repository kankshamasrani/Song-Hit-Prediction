Whitney Houston: So Emotional
-------------------------------

I don't know why I like it
I just do
Ooh, ooh

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head, uh

I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own babe
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much uh

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do, hee

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk I just watch your mouth

Ooh, I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much, no

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do, hee hee

Ha
See I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much, no no no

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I get so emotional baby
Everytime I think of you
I get so emotional baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I get so emotional, ooh baby
(I get so emotional baby)
Shocking what love can do
(I get so emotional baby)
Hey yeah baby baby baby
Baby baby
(I get so emotional baby)
(Everytime I think of you)
(I get so emotional baby)
Oh ain't it shocking what love can do

Yeah baby
(I get so emotional baby)
Shocking what
