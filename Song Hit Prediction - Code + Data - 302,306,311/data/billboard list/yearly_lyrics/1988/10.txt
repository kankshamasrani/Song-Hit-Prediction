Steve Winwood: Roll With It
-----------------------------

When life is too much, roll with it, baby
Don't stop and lose your touch, oh no, baby
Hard times knocking on your door
I'll tell them you ain't there no more
Get on through it, roll with it, baby

Luck'll come and then slip away
You gotta move, bring it back to stay

You just roll with it, baby, come on and just
Roll with it, baby, you and me
Roll with it, baby, hang on and just
Roll with it, baby

The way that you love is good as money
I swear by stars above, sweet as honey
People think you're down and out
You show them what it's all about
You can make it, roll with it, baby

When this world turns its back on you
Hang in and do that sweet thing you do

You just roll with it, baby, hey
You just roll with it, baby
Come on and just roll with it, baby, you and me
Just roll with it, baby

You just roll with it, baby, hey
You just roll with it, baby, you and me
Just roll with it, baby
Hang on and just roll with it, baby, hey

Now there'll be a day you'll get there, baby
You'll hear the music play, you'll dance, baby
You'll leave bad times way behind
Nothing but good times on your mind
You can do it, roll with it, baby

Then you'll see life will be so nice
It's just a step up to paradise

You just roll with it, baby, Hey
You just roll with it, baby, you and me
Just roll with it, baby, Hang on
And just roll with it, baby

Roll with it, babyHang on baby
Come on, roll with it, baby
Roll
Hey, come on just roll
Roll with it, baby

Hang on and just roll
Hey, on on
