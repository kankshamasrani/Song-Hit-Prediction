Van Halen: When It's Love
---------------------------

Hey!

Everybody's lookin' for somethin'
Somethin' to fill in the holes
We think a lot but don't talk much about it
'Til things get out of control

Oh! (How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Ohh (How does it feel when it's love?)
It's just something you feel together
When it's love

You look at every face in a crowd
Some shine and some keep you guessin'
Waiting for someone to come into focus
Teach you your final love lesson

(How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Ohh (How does it feel when it's love?)
It's just something you feel together

(Oh oh, oh oh)
Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh, oh oh)
You can feel it, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Nothing's missing, yeah

(Oh oh, oh oh)
Yeah, you can feel it
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Oh, when it's love
(Oh oh, oh oh)
Nothing's missing, ow!

(How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
Ohh (How does it feel when it's love?)
It's just something you feel together

Hey (How do I know when it's love?)
I can't tell you but it lasts forever
When it's love
Ooh, when it's love
Hey! It'll last forever

(Na na na na na, na)
When it's love
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
You and I, we're gonna feel this thing together
(Na na na na na, na)
When it's love
(Na na na na na, na)
Ooh, when it's love, baby
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
You can feel it, yeah!
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
We'll make it last forever
(Na na na na na, na)
(Na na na na na, na)
Ooh, it's love
