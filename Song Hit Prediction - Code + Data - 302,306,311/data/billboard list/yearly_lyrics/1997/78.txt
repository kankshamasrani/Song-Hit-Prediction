Aaliyah: The One I Gave My Heart To
-------------------------------------

How could the one I gave my heart to break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me so I can understand?
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that?

How could the one I gave my world to throw my world away?
How could the one who said "I love you" say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to go and break this heart of mine? Tell me...

How could you be so cold to me when I gave you everything?
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever
I can't understand

How could the one I shared my dreams with take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me?
Somebody tell me please
If you love me, how could you do that to me?
Tell me... (Whoa-oh-oh, hey hey, hey hey, mm mm, yeah yeah)

How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever
I can't understand...
No, I can't understand

How could the one I gave my heart to break my heart so bad? (Break my heart)
How could the one who made me happy (You made me so happy) make me feel so sad? (You made me feel so sad)
Won't somebody tell me (Won't you tell me), so I can understand? (So I can understand)
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that? (How could you hurt me?)

How could the one I gave my world to throw my world away? (Throw my world away)
How could the one who said "I love you" (You said you loved me, but you didn't love me) say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to (Yeah, you did) just tell me lies? (You told me lies)
How could the one I gave my heart to make me feel so sad? (Hey, yeah)
How could the one I gave my heart to break my heart so bad?
Tell me... oh mm, tell me...
