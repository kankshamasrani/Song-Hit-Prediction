----------------

You have so many relationships in this life
But only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
Oh yeah, they're gone so fast, yeah

Oh, so hold on to the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
When you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care?
Can you tell me who will still care? Oh, care

Keep planting to find out which one grows
