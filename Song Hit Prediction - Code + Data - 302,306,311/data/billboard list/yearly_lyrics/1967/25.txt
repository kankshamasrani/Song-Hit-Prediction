Vicki Carr: It Must Be Him
----------------------------

I tell myself what's done is done
I tell myself don't be a fool
Play the field have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool
I tell myself don't be a chump
Who cares let him stay away
That's when the phone rings
And I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray
Let it please be him
Oh dear God
It must be him
It must be him 
Or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello,
My dear God, it must be him
But it's not him and then I die
That's when I die
After a while
I'm myself again
I pick the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
He'll never hurt me anymore
I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
Thats when the phone rings
And once again I start to pray
Let it please be him
Oh, dear God, 
It must be him
It must be him 
Or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh, hello, hello, my dear God 
It must be him
But it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die
Let it please be him 
My dear God, it must be him
Or I shall die
Or I shall die
