Wings: Goodnight Tonight
--------------------------

Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end (ooh)
Don't say goodnight to love
It may never be the same again

Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything
Don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything
Don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
You can say anything
But don't say goodnight tonight

Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything
Don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything
But don't say goodnight tonight, ooh

Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end
Don't say goodnight to love
It's a feeling that may never end

Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything
Don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
Say anything
Don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
You can say anything
Don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it
Don't say it
