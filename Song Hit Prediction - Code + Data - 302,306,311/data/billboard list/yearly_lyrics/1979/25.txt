The Jackson 5: Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground)
-----------------------------------------------------

I don't know what's going to happen to you, baby
But I do know that I love you
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
Cause you do know that I want you
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky
And you do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

You are the spark that lit the fire inside of me
And you know that I love it
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
Cause you do know that I want you
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want you

Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground
Let's dance, let's shout
Take it over

Down, down, down, down, down
Take it over
