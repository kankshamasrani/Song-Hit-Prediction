Ambrosia: How Much I Feel
---------------------------

I don't know how
This whole business started
Of you thinkin' that 
I had been untrue

But if you think that
We'd be better parted
It's gonna hurt me but 
I'll break away from you

Well, just give me the sign
And I will be gone, yeah

That's how much I feel
Feel for you baby
How much I need
I need your touch
How much I live
I live for your lovin'
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much, ooh

Sleep alone and 
Late at night I'm dreamin'
Of the togetherness 
That seems to be leavin' me

Oh no, I'd give it all and 
Then I'd, give some more
If you would only love me
Like you had before

Oh, take hold of my hand
And all will be forgiven

That's how much I feel
Feel for you baby
How much I need
I need your touch
How much I live
I live for your lovin'
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much

So you try
Try to stay in the middle
And then you cry
Well, you cry just a little
Then we both realize
Just how foolish you've been
Ooh, and you try to make amends
But you're better off as friends

'Cause that's how much
That's how much
That's how much
That's how much, ooh

How's your life been goin' on?
I got a wife now
Years we've been going strong

Oh no, there's just something 
That I got to say
Sometimes when we make love
I still can see your face
Ooh, just try to recall
When we were as one, yeah

That's how much I feel
Feel for you baby
How much I need
I need your touch
How much I live
I live for your loving
That's how much
That's how much
