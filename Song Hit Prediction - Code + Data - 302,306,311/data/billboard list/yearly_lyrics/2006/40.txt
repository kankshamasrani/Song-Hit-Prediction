The Pussycat Dolls: Stickwitu
-------------------------------

I don't wanna go another day,
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind.
Seems like everybody's breaking up
Throwing their love away,
But I know I got a good thing right here
That's why I say (hey)

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick wit' you forever.
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick wit' you.
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick wit' you, my baby.
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick wit' you.

I don't wanna go another day
So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind.
See the way we ride in our private lives,
Ain't nobody getting in between.
I want you to know that you're the only one for me (one for me)
And I say

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick wit' you forever.
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick wit' you.
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick wit' you, my baby.
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick wit' you.

And now
Ain't nothing else I can need (nothing else I can need)
And now
I'm singing 'cause you're so, so into me.

I got you,
We'll be making love endlessly.
I'm with you (baby, I'm with you)
Baby, you're with me (baby, you're with me)

So don't you worry about
People hanging around,
They ain't bringing us down.
I know you and you know me
And that's all that counts.

So don't you worry about
People hanging around,
They ain't bringing us down.
I know you and you know me
And that's why I say

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick wit' you forever.
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick wit' you.
You know how to appreciate me
I must stick wit' you, my baby.
Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick wit' you.

Nobody gonna love me better
I must stick wit' you forever.
Nobody gonna take me higher
I must stick wit' you.

Nobody ever made me feel this way
I must stick wit' you.
