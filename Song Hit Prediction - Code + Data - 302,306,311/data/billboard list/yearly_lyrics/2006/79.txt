Danity Kane: Show Stopper
---------------------------

(feat Diddy & Young Joc) 

(Group) 
We in the car, we ride slow 
We doin things that the girls don't do 
The boys stare, we smile back 
All my girls in the rainbow cadillac 

(Diddy) 
(talkin) Ya'll wanna be stars 
I'll make you a star 
Check this out 

(Diddy rap) 
I keep the hood of that coupe warm 
Wrinkle free suits on 
Her hand shake from me's 
A redeemable coupon 
Knowin me will get you all the little perks 
So you need ta double back 
Throw that auto in reverse 
It's pure beauty 
Can finally put a face to it 
So never stop shorty girl 
Leak break fluid 
Tanight pedicures, walkin on better floors 
Beat it in your S Don, Jimmy Choo, better stores 
I been around the globe, my english is rusty 
Trust me, you can hear that ocean when you touch me 
I know you due for sale, you ain't gettin stepped on 
Or overlooked 
Pardon me, forgive me, my name's Sean 

(Aubrey) 
Showstoppin at the lastest spot 
The ride shinin with the open top 
Hydraulics make our heads go nod 
Hair blowin in the breeze, yo we superstars 

(D.Woods) 
Put in they keys make that engine purr 
3 in the back 1 in the passenger 
Slow creepin cause we look that fly 
All the boys tryna taste our candy ride 

(Bridge - Shannon lead vocal) 
We in the car, we ride slow 
We doin things that the girls don't do 
The boys stare, we smile back 
All my girls in the rainbow cadillacs, yeah 

(Chorus) 
Bet you ain't never seen (hey!) 
Chicks ridin this clean (hey!) 
Louis Vitton seats (oh, oh, oh!) 
We do it deadly 
That's how we keep it poppin (hey!) 
Make sure the bass knockin (hey!) 
So when you see us ridin (oh, oh, oh!)

(Aundrea) 
We sittin on 22's plus 2 
Mink bucket seats, neon blue 
Color-coordinate with them shoes 
Ya, we divas but we ride like big boys do 

(D.Woods) 
Black tinted with a white stripe interstate 
Lookin in the mirror at my bad boy fitted, yup 
Show stoppin till they lose they breath 
Turn the wheel to the right, turn the wheel to the left 

(Bridge - Shannon lead vocal) 
We in the car, we ride slow 
We doin things that the girls don't do 
The boys stare, we smile back 
All my girls in the rainbow cadillacs, yeah

(Breakdown - Dawn lead vocal) 
This is for my ladies in the 280's Mercedes 
In the H3, Baby Ranges, Bentley Coups, Escalades 
Say oh (oh!) Oh (oh oh!) 
Break 'em off somethin proper like a real show stopper 

(Aubrey lead vocal) 
This is for chicas with the Beamers, A6's 
67 Chevy, Maserati, or a Lexus 
Say oh (oh!) Oh (oh oh!) 
Break 'em off somethin proper like a real show stopper 

(Young Joc rap) 
Hey shawty, baby hey 
Ain't never seen chicks like this before 
Thousand dollar jeans with them candy 6 4's 
Louis V sneaks match your Louis V seats 
See ya swag like no other, so them other's can't compete 
Independent and discrete 
Check her VDS piece 
Melt in ya mouth like M&Ms, kapeesh 
She do whatever she wanna do 
Money out the ying yang 
Blowin a dollar and the change 
In the Rover switchin lanes 
Imma take her under my wings, Imma teach her things 
She say she got paper cuts from countin all this change 
Tell her meet the parents 
Like Ben Stiller 
Baby say she want them carrots and the chinchillas 

(Bridge - Shannon lead vocal) 
We in the car, we ride slow 
We doin things that the girls don't do 
The boys stare, we smile back 
All my girls in the rainbow cadillacs, yeah
