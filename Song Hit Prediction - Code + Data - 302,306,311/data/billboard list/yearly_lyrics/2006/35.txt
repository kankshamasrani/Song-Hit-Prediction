Ludacris: Money Maker
-----------------------

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you a fader, she...

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
Don't worry 'bout them haters
Keep your nose up in the air

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye

Shake, shake, shake your money maker
Like you was shaking it for some paper
Took your mama nine months to make ya
Might as well shake what your mama gave ya

You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind

I got my hoe on my right side, pouring some cups
My whole hood is on to left and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get loose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today

But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile high points you earn when we taking my jets
And how everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet, 'cause you can

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you a fader, she...

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
Don't worry 'bout them haters
Keep your nose up in the air

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye

Switch, switch, switch it from right to left
And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends

As you want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to
Hey, hey, Luda, I am on top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame

And I just wanna take a little ride on your curves
And get erotic giving your body just what it deserves
And let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius

Yup, call me the renaissance man
Get up and I stay harder then a cinderblock man
Hey i'm just a bedroom gangster
And I been meaning to tell you that I really must thank ya when ya

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you a fader, she...

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
Don't worry 'bout them haters
Keep your nose up in the air

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye

Rock, rock, rock it and make it work, girl
Please don't stop until it hurt, girl
You, you been looking a little tipsy
So if you could just shake it a little this way

See I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
And you the center of attention that's distracting the squad
'Cause everybody in the camp is like "Oh my God, she can-"

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you a fader, she...

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye

Shake your money maker
Like somebody 'bout to pay you
Don't worry 'bout them haters
Keep your nose up in the air

You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like aye, aye, aye
