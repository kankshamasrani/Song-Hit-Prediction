Kelly Clarkson: Walk Away
---------------------------

You've got your mother and your brother
Every other, undercover
Telling you what to say
You think I'm stupid 
But the truth is that it's cupid 
Baby, loving you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hand off of my trigger, oh yeah
You need to know
The situations getting old
And now the more you talk the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I waited here for you
Like a kid waiting after school
So tell me, how come you never showed? (show)
I gave you everything
And never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (alone)
So before you start defendin'
Baby, stop all your pretendin'...
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow
Let's get this show on the road today, hey...

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I want a love, I want a fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me, die for me
Live and breathe for me
Do you care for me
Cause if you don't then just leave

I'm looking for attention
Not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well if you don't have the answer
Why you still standing here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey... just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

If you don't have the answer (walk away)
Walk away (just walk away)
Just leave (walk away)
Walk away

Walk away
