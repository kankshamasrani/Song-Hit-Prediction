Sam The Sham & The Pharaohs: Wooly Bully
------------------------------------------

Uno, dos, one, two, tres, quatro
Eh, Wooly Bully
Watch it now, watch it

Matty told Hatty about a thing she saw
Had two big horns and a wooly jaw

Wooly bully, wooly bully (yeah, drive)
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully

Hatty told Matty, "Let's don't take no chance
Let's not be L-seven, come and learn to dance

Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully
Watch it now, watch it, watch it, ah

Yeah
Drive, drive, drive

Matty told Hatty, "That's the thing to do
Get you someone really to pull the wool with you"

Wooly bully, wooly bully
Wooly bully, wooly bully, wooly bully
Watch it now
You got it
