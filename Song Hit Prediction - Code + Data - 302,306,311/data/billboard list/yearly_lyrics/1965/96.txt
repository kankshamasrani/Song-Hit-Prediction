Jack Jones: The Race Is On
----------------------------

I feel tears well in up from deep inside
Like my heart's goin' to break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
You might say that I was takin' it hard
Since you gave me the final goodbye
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and cry

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

One day I ventured in love, never once suspectin'
What the final results would be
How I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'
And find that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For the name of the one that I'll never replaced
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place

Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all
