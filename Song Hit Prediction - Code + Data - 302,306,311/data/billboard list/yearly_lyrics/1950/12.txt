Kay Starr: Bonaparte's Retreat
--------------------------------

Met the man I love
In a town way down in Dixie
'Neath the stars above
He was the sweetest man you ever did see

When he held me in his arms
And told me of my many charms
He kissed me while the fiddles played
The Bonaparte's retreat

All the world was bright
When he held me on that night
And I heard him say
"Please don't ever go away"

When he held me in his arms
And told me of my many charms
He kissed me while the fiddles played
The Bonaparte's retreat

When he held me in his arms
And told me of my many charms
He kissed me while the fiddles played
The Bonaparte's retreat

All the world was bright
When he held me on that night
And I heard him say
"Please don't you go away"

He's gone and I'll admit I knew
That I had met my waterloo
I knew that he would say a do
With Bonaparte's retreat

Goodbye little boy
Goodbye little Joy
Goodbye little boy
So long little Joy
Goodbye little boy
