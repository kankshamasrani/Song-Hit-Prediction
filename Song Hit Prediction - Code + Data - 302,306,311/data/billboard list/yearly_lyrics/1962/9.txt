Chubby Checker: The Twist
---------------------------

Come on baby
Let's do the twist
Come on baby
Let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand
And go like this

Ee-yah twist
Baby, baby twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on little miss and do the twist

My daddy is sleepin'
And mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy just sleepin'
And mama ain't around
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty
Till we tear the house down

Come on and twist
Yeah, baby twist
Oooh yeah, just like this
Come on miss and do the twist
Ee-yah

('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)

Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my my litlle Sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist

Come on and twist
Yeah, baby twist
Oooh yeah, just like this
Come on little miss and do the twist

('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)

Yeah, rock on now
Yeah, twist on down
Twist
('Round and 'round and 'round)
