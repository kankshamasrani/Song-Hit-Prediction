Cyndi Lauper: All Through The Night
-------------------------------------

All through the night
I'll be awake
And I'll be with you
All through the night
This precious time
When time is new
Oh
All through the night today
Knowing that we feel the same without saying

We have no past
We won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no end

All through the night
Stray cat is crying
So stray cat sings back
All through the night
They have forgotten
What binding they lack
Oh
Under those white street lamps
There is a little chance they may see

We have no past
We won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no end

Oh
The sleep in your eyes is enough
Let me be there, let me stay there a while

We have no past
We won't reach back
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no end
Keep with me forward all through the night
And once we start
The meter clicks
And it goes running all through the night
Until it ends
There is no end
