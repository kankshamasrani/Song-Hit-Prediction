Glenn Frey: You Belong To The City
------------------------------------

The sun goes down
The night rolls in
You can feel it starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
You can feel the crowds through the midnight heat
The traffic roars
And the sirens scream
You look at the faces, its just like a dream

Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

'Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
living in a river of darkness, beneath the neon light
You were born in the city
Concrete under your feet
Its in your moves, its in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Tryin' to get away from the things you'd done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened, but nothing has changed

You still don't know where you're going
Your still just a face in the crowd

'Cause you belong to the city...

You can feel it
You can taste it
You can see it
You can face it
You can hear it
You're getting near it
You're gonna make it
'Cause you can take it.

You belong to the city (etc. to fade out)
