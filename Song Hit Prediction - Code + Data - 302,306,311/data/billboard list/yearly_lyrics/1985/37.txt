Chicago: You're The Inspiration
---------------------------------

You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I want you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

You should know, everywhere I go
You're always on my mind
In my heart, in my soul, baby

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration

Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me, say it
No-one needs you more than I need you

And I know (And I know), yes, I know that it's plain to see
We're so in love when we're together
And I know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time

You should know, everywhere I go
You're always on my mind
In my heart, in my soul

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration

Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me, say it
No-one needs you more than I need you

Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me, say it
No-one needs you more than I need you

You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring feeling to my life
You're the inspiration

(When you love somebody) 'Till the end of time
(When you love somebody) Always on my mind
No-one needs you more than I need you

(When you love somebody) 'Till the end of time
(When you love somebody) Always on my mind
No-one needs you more than I need you

(When you love somebody) 'Till the end of time
(When you love somebody) Always on my mind
