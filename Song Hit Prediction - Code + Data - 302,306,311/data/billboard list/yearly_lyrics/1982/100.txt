Stevie Nicks: Edge Of Seventeen
---------------------------------

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo

And the days go by like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own, I begin again
Said to my friend, baby, nothin' else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him, all alone 
On the edge of...seventeen

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo

I went today, maybe I will go again tomorrow
And the music there it was hauntingly familiar
And I see you doing what I try to do for me
With the words from a poet and the voice from a choir
And a melody, nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo

The clouds never expect it when it rains
But the sea changes colours, but the sea
Does not change
And so with the slow, graceful flow of age
I went forth with an age old desire to please
On the edge of...seventeen

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo

Well then suddenly there was no one 
Left standing in the hall
In a flood of tears that 
No one really ever heard fall at all
Oh I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer, just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing "Come away" (Come away)

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo

Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you at nightfall
Sometime to be near you 
Is to be unable to hear you, my love
I'm a few years older than you
(I'm a few years older than you) my love

Just like the white winged dove sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
Just like the white winged sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Whoo, whoo, whoo
