Dru Hill: We're Not Making Love No More
-----------------------------------------

Said I've been in love a time or two
But in the end I still chose you
No one could ever make me feel this way
That's why it's killing me, what we're going through
Somehow thought 'tween me and you
Our love would stand the test of time and never ever fade

But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same

Girl I know that things aren't going right
But don't you think it deserves a fight
A love like ours don't happen everyday
And we're losing it right as we speak
And if we don't wake up, it's a memory
A time gone past, a love that sailed away

But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same

I dream of lovers past and
I see a girl so sad cause
She lost the only man she loved
He went away
Well it's not too late for us
To change

But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same

Dru Hill help me sing it
Whoa whoa whoa whoa (Said whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa (Said whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa (Hey hey, hey)
Does it ever stay the same
Whoa whoa whoa whoa (Sometimes I get a little lonely)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa (Do you remember)
Whoa whoa whoa whoa (When you said to me, Sisqo)
Will it ever stay the same (yeah)

But we're not making love no more
We're not even trying to change
Tell me how it slips away
Does it ever stay the same
We don't even talk no more
We've ran out of words to say
Tell me it don't have to change
Won't it ever stay the same
