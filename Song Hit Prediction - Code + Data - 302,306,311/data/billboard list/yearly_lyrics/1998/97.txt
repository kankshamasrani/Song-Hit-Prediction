LL Cool J: Father
-------------------

Talking - I swear to tell the truth n nuthing but the truth. So help me God
I just felt like telling the story of my life. Felt like maybe
Somebody would be inspired ya know. We all feel pain. We 
all go through things But it's time to overcome all of that.

VERSE 1: Your plane crashed down in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldnt move
They called me a cripple, pops caught and attitude
Beat moms smoke lots drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage he didnt give a f**k
He sniffed some coke come home he beat up moms for talking on the phone

CHORUS: All I ever wanted all I ever needed was a father
Thats all (THATS ALL)
All I ever wanted All I ever needed waaaaas (WAS A FATHER) was a father

VERSE 2: Moms got tired of the beatings said "yo we gots to go"
Packed up the bags we bounced out the door
She said "I aint take these whippings no more I wanna live to see my little child grow"
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me  standing at me on the staircase
Hand to mother with a smooth goatee Make me wonder we he acted so ugly
Ya feelin me? (ya feelin me?)

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE 3: My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dans siffed up an ounce
Grab the shot he left  long out for Queens
Possessed by a demon... A devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risks when
your moms comes home from a midnight shift.
she turned around hear the shotgun click
My pops said "you think you can leave me?" (Leave me?)
He blasted my moms in the back she fell down screaming I cant forget that
My Grandfather tried to close the door
He got shot 10 times in the stomach YO. Fo real

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE 4: My head was spinning I aint never seen blood
4 years old this dont feel like love
Anyway Pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe that without him she's be dead
You know they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed righ thats word to mother (Word to mother)
Until i started getting beatings everyday
sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees i'd pray
Young child wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat me wit belts like a slave wit a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest knocked me out on the floor
Thats just the tip of the iceburg look
its too long for a song
but perfect it for a book
Word is bond, thats real baby

REAPEAT CHORUS TIL FADE
I AINT MAD ATCHU DAD
I AINT MAD
I AINT MAD ATCHU DAD
NOW YOU FEEL ME
I AINT MAD ATCHU DAD
NAH I AINT MAD ATCHU
IT'S ALL GOOD
LIVE LON, BE STRONG
TAKE CARE OF YOUR KIDS
(is a father) IMMA TAKE CARE OF MINE
(thats all i ever wanted) PEACE
(thats all i ever needed)
NEVER GIVE UP NO MATTER WHAT 
NEVER GIVE UP
OVERCOME THE PAIN
KEEP THE FAITH 
BE FAITHFUL TO GOD
KEEP STRIDING
