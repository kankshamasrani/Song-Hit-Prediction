Club Nouveau: Lean On Me
--------------------------

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow

Lean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (lean on me)
For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show

Lean on me
When you're not strong
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (Lean on me)
For it won't be long
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Lean on me
When you're not strong (when you're not strong)
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your friend)
I'll help you carry on (lean on me)
For, said, a-it won't be long (won't be too long)
Till I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on

We be jammin'
We be jammin', hey now
We be jammin'

We be jammin'
We be jammin', a-hey

We be jammin'

(Just call me) When you need a friend
(Call me) Oh, baby now
(Call me) When you need a friend
(Call me) Oh, baby now
(Call me) When you need a friend
(Call me) Oh, baby now
(Call me) Lean on me
