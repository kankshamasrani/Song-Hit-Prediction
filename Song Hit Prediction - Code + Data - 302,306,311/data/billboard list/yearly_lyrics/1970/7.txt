The Jackson 5: I'll Be There
------------------------------

You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)

You know, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you, I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Yes I will, yes I will

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, girl, is all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there (I'll be there)

I'll be there to protect you (Yeah, baby)
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name and I'll be there (I'll be there)

You know, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you, I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Yes I will, yes I will

If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah?
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh!

I'll be there
I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah?
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
I'll be there
