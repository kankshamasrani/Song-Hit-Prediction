Marmalade: Reflections Of My Life
-----------------------------------

The changing of sunlight to moonlight
Reflections of my life
Oh, how they fill my eyes
The greetings of people in trouble
Reflections of my life
Oh, how they fill my eyes

All my sorrow
Sad tomorrow
Take me back to my old home   
All my crying (all my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
Take me back to my old home

I'm changing, arranging
I'm changing, I'm changing everything
Ah, everything around me
The world is a bad place
A bad place, a terrible place to live
Oh, but I don't wanna die

All my sorrow
Sad tomorrow
Take me back to my old home   
All my crying (all my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
Take me back to my old home

All my sorrow (all my sorrow)
Sad towmorrow
Take me back (take me back) to my old home
All my crying (all my crying)
Feel I'm dying, dying
