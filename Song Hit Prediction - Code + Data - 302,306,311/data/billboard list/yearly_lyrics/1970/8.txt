Rare Earth: Get Ready
-----------------------

Never met a girl could make me feel the way that you do
Whenever I'm asked what makes my dreams real, I tell 'em you do
Well, tweedlee dee, tweedlee dum, look out, baby, 'cause here I come

I'm bringin' you a love that's true, get ready
Start makin' love to you, get ready 
Oh, don't you know I'm coming
On my way

You wanna play hide and seek with love, let me remind ya
Lovin' you're gonna miss and the time it takes to find ya
Well, fe fi fo fo fum, look out, baby, now, here I come

I'm bringin' you a love that's true, aw, get ready
Start makin' love to you, get ready
Don't you know I'm comin', on my way

If all my friends shouldn't want me to, I think I'll understand
Hope I get to you before they do, 'cause that's how I planned it
Well, tweedlee dee, now, tweedlee dum, look out, baby, now, here I come

I'm  bringin' you a love that's true, get ready
I'll start makin' love to you, get ready
Don't you know I'm coming
On my way
