Dion: Runaround Sue
---------------------

Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love then ran around
With every single guy in town

(Hey, hey) Woah
(Hey, hey) Woah
(Hey, hey) Woah
(Hey, hey) Woah

Yeah, I should have known it from the very start
This girl would leave me with a broken heart
Now listen people what I'm telling you
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue, yeah

I miss her lips and the smile on her face
The touch of her hand and this girl's warm embrace
So if you don't wanna cry like I do
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

(Hey, hey) Woah
(Hey, hey) Woah
(Hey, hey) Woah

She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
Sue goes out with other guys

Here's the moral in the story from the guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
Keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Yyeah keep away from this girl
I don't know what she'll do
Keep away from Sue!

She likes to travel around, yeah
She'll love you and she'll put you down
Now people let me put you wise
She goes out with other guys

Here's the moral in the story from that guy who knows
I fell in love and my love still grows
Ask any fool that she ever knew, they'll tell ya
A-keep away from-a Runaround Sue

Stay away from that girl
Don't you know what she'll do now
Woah
Woah
Woah
Keep away from that girl
