Tony Orlando: Bless You
-------------------------

Every time I faced the world 
I just had to cry
I stood alone with no love of my own
But then You happened by

Chorus:
Oh, darling, bless You
Bless every breath that You take 
Bless every move that You make so perfectly 
And bless Your little heart for loving me

Bless You, bless You, child

Till You smiled and took my hand 
I felt kind of small
But You stood by me for the whole world to see
And then I was ten feet tall

Repeat Chorus and then fade
