Los Bravos: Black Is Black
----------------------------

Black is black
I want my baby back.
It's grey, it's grey,
Since she went away

Oh-oh, what can I do??
'cause I-I-I-I-I,
I'm feelin' blue.

If I had my way,
She'd be back today.
But she don't need time
To see me again.

Oh-oh, what can I do
'cause I-I-I-I-I,
I'm feelin' blue.

I can't choose,
It's too much to lose
My love's too strong.
Maybe she
Would come back to me
What did I do wrong?

Bad is bad,
This fella is so sad.
It's time, it's time,
That I found peace of mind.

Oh-oh, what can I do
'cause I-I-I-I-I,
I'm feelin' blue.

I can't choose,
It's too much to lose
My love's too strong.
Maybe she
Would come back to me
What did I do wrong?

Black is black
I want my baby back.
It's gray, it's gray,
Since she went away

Oh-oh, what can I do
'cause I-I-I-I-I,
I'm feelin' blue.

'cause I-I-I-I-I,
I'm feelin' blue...
