Shadows Of Knight: Gloria
---------------------------

Like to tell you 'bout my baby
You know she comes around
She's 'bout five feet four
Oh from her head to the ground

Now she comes around here
Just about midnight
She makes me feel so good
She makes me feel alright

And her name is G L O R I
G L O R I A, Gloria
G L O R I A, Gloria
I'm gonna shout all night, Gloria
Gonna shout at every place, Gloria
Yeah, yeah, yeah

She comes around here
Just about midnight
She makes me feel so good
I wanna tell you she makes me feel alright

Comes walkin' down my street
Once came up to my house
Knocks upon my door
And then she called out my name
For having me feel alright

G L O R I A, Gloria
G L O R I A, Gloria
I'm gonna shout all night, Gloria
Gonna shout at every place, Gloria
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's so good, Gloria
It's alright
It's so good, Gloria
It's alright
Wow!
