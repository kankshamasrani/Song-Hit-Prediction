Eddie Kendricks: Boogie Down
------------------------------

Boogie, boogie down, baby
Ooo uh, boogie
Baby, let's boogie down

I'm bad enough to make another bad lie
I'm gonna hook you on a natural high
And I know, I can satisfy, hey
I wanna love ya, kiss and hug you, baby, tonight

Ooh hoo, tonight
Boo hoo hoo, boogie down

Hey, hey, boogie, boogie down, baby
Ooo uh, boogie
Baby, let's boogie down

Let's get it on, girl, don't hesitate
Let my love flood your water gate
Sweet lover, don't make me wait, hey
I wanna love ya, kiss and hug ya, baby, tonight

Make ya feel alright
Boo hoo hoo ooh ooh, boogie down

Boogie down, boogie down, baby
Boogie down, boogie down, baby
Boogie, boogie down, baby
Boogie, boogie down, baby

Boogie hmm, have mercy
Boogie down, baby
Boogie down, boogie down, baby

Boogie ah, ha
Boogie down, baby
Boogie down, boogie down, baby

Go downtown
Gonna mess around
Uh huh huh huh
Boogie down, uh huh

Go downtown
Gonna mess around
Ah ha ha ha
Boogie down

Like a hound, gonna sniff around
Ah ha ha ha, boogie down
I found a girl, love you up and down
Ah ha ha ha, boogie down

Boogie, boogie down, baby
Boogie down, boogie down, baby

Boogie, hey hey y'all boogie down, baby
Boogie down, boogie down, baby
Ooh, have mercy

Boogie ooh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Boogie down, baby
Boogie down
