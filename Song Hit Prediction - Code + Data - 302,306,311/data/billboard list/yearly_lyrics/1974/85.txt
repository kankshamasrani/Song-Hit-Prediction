Jim Croce: I'll Have To Say I Love You In A Song
--------------------------------------------------

Well, I know it's kinda late.
I hope I didn't wake you.
But what I gotta say can't wait,
I know you'd understand.

Every time I tried to tell you,
The words just came out wrong,
So I'll have to say I love you in a song.

Yeah, I know it's kinda strange.
Every time I'm near you,
I just run out of things to say.
I know you'd understand.

Every time I tried to tell you,
The words just came out wrong,
So I'll have to say I love you in a song.

Every time the time was right,
All the words just came out wrong,
So I'll have to say I love you in a song

Yeah, I know it's kinda late.
Hope I didn't wake you,
But there's something I just gotta say.
Know you'd understand.

Every time I tried to tell you,
The words just came out wrong
So I'll have to say I love you in a song.
