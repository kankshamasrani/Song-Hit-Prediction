Donna Summer: Last Dance
--------------------------

Last dance
Last chance for love
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight
I need you by me
Beside me, to guide me
To hold me, to scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

So let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance this last dance tonight

Last dance
Last chance for love
Yes, it's my last chance
For romance tonight
Oh, I need you by me
Beside me, to guide me
To hold me, to scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

So let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance
Let's dance the last dance tonight

So let's dance the last dance 
Let's dance the last dance 
Let's dance the last dance tonight 


Oh, I need you by me
Beside me, to guide me
To hold me and to scold me
'Cause when I'm bad, I'm so, so bad

So, come on, baby, dance that dance 
Come on, baby, dance that dance 
Come on, baby, let's dance tonight 
Yeah
