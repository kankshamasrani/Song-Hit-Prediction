Christina Aguilera: What A Girl Wants
---------------------------------------

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Yeah, come on
Oh, yeah

I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe
Like a rock you waited so patiently
While I got it together
Hmm, while I figured it out, yeah

I only looked but I never touched
'Cause in my heart was a picture of us
Holding hands, making plans
And it's lucky for me, you understand

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for givin' it to me

What I want is what you got
And what you got is what I want

There was a time I was blind I was so confused (Yeah, yeah)
Ran away just to hide it all from you
But, baby, you knew me better
Than I knew myself

They say if you love something let it go (Let it go)
If it comes back it's yours, that's how you know
It's for keeps, yeah, it's for sure
And you're ready and willing to give me more than

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free
And I'm thanking you for knowing exactly

What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms
And I'm thanking you for giving it to me, yeah

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs)
Somebody sensitive, crazy sexy cool like you, yeah
(What a girl wants, what a girl needs)
Yes, you got it, it's what I want (Oh yeah!)

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs) It's alright, it's alright
You let a girl know how much you care about her
I swear you're the one who always knew
Oh, you knew, you knew, you knew

Oooh, ohoho, I'm thanking you for being here for me

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever keeps me in your arms)
Whatever keeps me in your arms is what I need, ohohoho

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs
Whatever makes me happy sets you free) Oh, it's what I need

What a girl wants, you got it
(Whatever keeps me) My baby, I need you (In your arms)
'Cause you know (And I'm thanking you for giving it)

(What a girl wants, what a girl needs) What I want is what you got
What you got (Whatever makes me happy sets you free) is what I need
(And I'm thanking you for giving it to me) (Ohoho)

Oh, baby (Girl wants), oh darling (Girl needs)
Thank you, thank you for giving me what I want
And what I need (Girl wants, girl needs), ohohoho, yeah, yeah!
