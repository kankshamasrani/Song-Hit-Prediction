Avant: Separated
------------------

Oh yes listen babe
Every time I see you I get a bad vibe
Just thinkin of someone else in between your thighs
And you thought you were slick had tricks up your sleeve
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
That's why I say

(Chorus)
When we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another

I don't wanna be with you put that on everything I own
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
If I never see you again I won't be mad at all
Cause I believe that you are my downfall

(You did me wrong) you did me wrong I thought you were true (yeah)
You ran out of my life and now I'm so through with you
I wanted you to be there right here with me oh

(Repeat Chorus)

Baby tell me why

(Repeat Chorus)

It's really over baby
(Cause you did me wrong) you did me wrong I thought you were true
You ran out of my life and now I'm so through with you

I remember when you used to sit there
I would hold you in my arms and you would say to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I would rub your body you would say to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
When we were together you'd say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I can hear your body sayin
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sounds so good to me oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah

(Repeat Chorus 2X)
