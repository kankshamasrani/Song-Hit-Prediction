Jagged Edge: He Can't Love U
------------------------------

I ain't no hata or nothing
But he can't love you like I can
Trust me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
As the clock strikes twelve
I'm 
Sitting here wondering how the hell
Did I let you leave
And 
Baby I know that I did my share
Of things to deceive you
I'm just trying to get an understanding
Of  what to do
Cause I'm half way going crazy
Girl they can't fade me

Chorus-
He can't love you like I love you
Baby you know it too
And you should never wanna be with a man
If he can't be a man
And do the things to you like I can
(repeat)

I stop, and I wait, and I think
That I
Never met someone to make me feel
Like I'm ready to love
So I 
Gotta do what I gotta do
Just to keep you
Keep you here with me baby
Now I feel it's time for me to say
That I need you boo
and I can go a day with out your lovein
Baby I can live with out you

I know, you know
No matter were you want it baby
Aint no its  whats or buts or maybes
and I know one day you'll see
He can never love you like I love you
OOOO

Repeat Chorus
