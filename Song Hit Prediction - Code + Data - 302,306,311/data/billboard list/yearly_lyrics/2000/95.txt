Dixie Chicks: Cowboy Take Me Away
-----------------------------------

I said I want to touch the earth
I want to break it in my hands
I want to grow something wild and unruly
I want to sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of bluebonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me

I said, cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you 
Closer to you

I want to walk and not run
I want to skip and not fall
I want to look at the horizon
And not see a building standing tall
I want to be the only one
For miles and miles
Except for maybe you
And your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you

I said I want to touch the earth
I want to break it in my hands
I want to grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds so good to me

Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you
