Brewer & Shipley: One Toke Over The Line
------------------------------------------

One toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Who do you love, I hope it's me
I've been changing, as you can plainly see
I felt the joy and I learned about the pain
That my momma said
If I should choose to make a part of me
Well surely strike me dead

And now I'm one toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

I sail away a country mile
And now I'm returning and showing off my smile
I met all the girls and I loved myself a few
And to my surprise
Like everything else that I've been through
It opened up my eyes

And now I'm one toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line
Don't you know I'm just waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over the line

Don't you know I'm just waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary
Hoping that the train is on time
(Sitting downtown) Sitting in a railway station
One toke over the line

I want to be one toke over the line, sweet Jesus
One toke over the line
(Sitting downtown) Sitting in a railway station
One toke over the line

(Don't you know I'm just waiting for the train that goes home, sweet Mary) Waiting for the train that goes home
Hoping that the train is on time
(Sitting downtown) Sitting in a railway station
One toke over the line
Sitting downtown in a railway station
One toke over line
One toke, one toke over the line
