Donny Osmond: Sweet And Innocent
----------------------------------

I love the little wiggle in your walk
The way you cuddle on my shoulder
But you're too young to know the score
So come back when you're older

Cos you're too sweet
And innocent
But you're just
Oh, too young for me, yeah
The way you hold me, not too tight
The tender way you kiss goodnight
Tells me you've got some growing up to do
Whoa, oh

Young
And innocent
Is the love 
Oh, you give to me
You're not hip so get with it, girl
Go on home to your make believe world
Sweet and innocent
You're too young and beautiful
For me

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Sweet
And innocent
But you're just
Oh, too young for me
I'd like to kiss you and hold you tight
So go on home girl or I just might
Sweet and innocent
You're too young and beautiful
For me

You're so sweet (sweet, and innocent)
But you're much too young, little girl
Go on home
Just leave me alone, little girl...
