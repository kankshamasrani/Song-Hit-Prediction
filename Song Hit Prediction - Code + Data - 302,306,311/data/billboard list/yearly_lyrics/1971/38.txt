Carpenters: Rainy Days And Mondays
------------------------------------

Talking to myself and feeling old
Sometimes I'd like to quit, nothing ever seems to fit
Hanging around, nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

What I've got they used to call the blues
Nothing is really wrong, feeling like I don't belong
Walking around, some kind of lonely clown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

Funny but it seems I always wind up a-here with you
Nice to know somebody loves me
Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me

What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out, we know what it's all about
Hanging around, nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

Funny but it seems that it's the only thing to do
Run and find the one who loves me

What I feel has come and gone before
No need to talk it out, we know what it's all about
Hanging around, nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get me down

Hanging around, nothing to do but frown
Rainy days and Mondays always get, get me down
