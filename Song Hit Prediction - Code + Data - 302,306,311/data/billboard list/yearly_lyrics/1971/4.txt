The Osmonds: One Bad Apple
----------------------------

Yeah, yeah

I can tell you've been hurt
By that look on your face, girl
Some guy brought sadness
Into your happy world

You need love
But you're afraid that if you give in
Someone else will come along
And sock it to you again

One bad apple don't
Spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple don't
Spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard

I could make you happy, baby
Satisfy you too (satisfy you now)
But how can I if you
Won't give me a chance
To prove my love to you

Won't you just give me one
Little chance (one little chance now)
I'll give you love's guarantee
That you won't be hurt again

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now

I've been noticing you, baby
For a long, long time (long, long time now)
I'm not ashamed to tell the world
That you really messed up my mind

Girl, to me
You're like a dream come true (dream come true now)
I'd rather hurt myself
Than to ever hurt you

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
No, give it one more try
Before you give up on love

One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Oh now, I don't care what they say
I don't care what you heard now
