Dave Edmunds: I Hear You Knocking
-----------------------------------

You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knocking on my door

I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you've been

I begged you not to go but you said goodbye
And now you're telling me all your lies

I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you've been

You better get back to your used-to-be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me

I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you've been

I told you, baby, in '52
That I would never go with you

I hear you knocking
But you can't come in
I hear you knocking
Go back where you've been
