Perry Como: Kewpie Doll
-------------------------

Well I took my baby to the carnival  
an' I heard that barker yell ( Hey! Hey! ) 
"Come on an' win yourself a purdy Kewpie Doll,  
all you gotta do is ring the bell!" 
Well I swung the hammer just as hard as I could,  
an' you should have heard the wild applause . . . ( Hooray! ) 
When "bong" went the bell  
and the man said,  
"Well, I guess the Kewpie Doll is yours!"( Yeah Yeah! ) 

I said, "Gimmie a doggie or a teddy bear  
or a high school banner for my wall, 
'cause I got me a real live Kewpie Doll 
an' she's the cutest one of them all!" 

( Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!  
Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!  ) 

Ah then, we walked down the midway  
'till we saw a crowd an' the man said "Try your skill, 
five shots for a quarter, make a duck hit the water  
an' give your little baby a thrill" 
Well, my baby smiled an' she kissed me once  
an' I felt I was nine feet tall 
Oh! five shots crashed and the five ducks splashed  
an' the man gave me a Kewpie Doll!  

I said, "Gimmie a doggie or a teddy bear  
or a high school banner for my wall, 
'cause I got me a real live Kewpie Doll 
an' she's the cutest one of them all!" 

( Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!  
Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! Kew Kew Kewpie Doll!  ) 

Ah then, my baby said, "Honey, let m try my luck  
an' knock the milk bottles off the shelf!" 
You should have seen this chick, she was a dead-eye Dick  
Hey! I couldn't do it better myself! 
An' then my face got red and my chest swelled up  
an' my eyes bugged outta my head 
'cause when the prize turned out to be a Kewpie Doll  
this is what my baby said, SHE SAID . . .  

"Gimmie a doggie or a teddy bear  
or a high school banner for my wall, 
'cause I got me a real live Kewpie Doll 
an' he's the cutest one of them all!" 

I said, "She's the cutest one of them all!"  
An' she's the cutest one of them all! ( Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! ) 
An' she's the cutest one of them all! ( Kew Kew Kewpie Doll! ) 
An' she's the cutest one of them all!
