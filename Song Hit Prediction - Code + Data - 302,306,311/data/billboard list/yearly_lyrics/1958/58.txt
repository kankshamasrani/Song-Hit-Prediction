Earl Grant: The End
---------------------

At the end of a rainbow, you'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story, you'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts can always spend
And it has a story without any end

At the end of a river, the water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on 'til the end of time

At the end of a river, the water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on 'til the e-end of time

'Til the end of time
