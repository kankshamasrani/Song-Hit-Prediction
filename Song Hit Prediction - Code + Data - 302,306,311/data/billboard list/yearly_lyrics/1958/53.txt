Ricky Nelson: Lonesome Town
-----------------------------

There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken heart stays

You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears

Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
Going down to Lonesome Town
To cry my troubles away

In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
I can learn to forget
