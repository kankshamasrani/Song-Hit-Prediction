Timmy Thomas: Why Can't We Live Together
------------------------------------------

Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why.
Why can't we live together?
Tell me why, tell me why.
Why can't we live together?

Everybody wants to live together.
Why can't we be together?

No more war, no more war, no more war...
Just a little peace in this world.
No more war, no more war.
All we want is some peace in this world.

Everybody wants to live together.
Why can't we live together?

No matter, no matter what colour.
You are still my brother.
I said no matter, no matter what colour.
You are still my brother.

Everybody wants to live together
Why can't we be together?
