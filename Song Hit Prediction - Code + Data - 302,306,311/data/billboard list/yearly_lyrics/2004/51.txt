Switchfoot: Meant To Live
---------------------------

Fumbling his confidence and wondering why the world has passed him by.
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments and failed attempts to fly, to fly.

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

Dreaming about providence and whether mice and men have second tries.
Maybe we've been living with our eyes half open, maybe we're bent and broken, broken.

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than the wars of our fathers
And everything inside screams for second life.  Yeah

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?

We were meant to live.
We were meant to live.
