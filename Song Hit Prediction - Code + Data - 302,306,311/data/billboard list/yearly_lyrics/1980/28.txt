Kenny Loggins: This Is It
---------------------------

There've been times in my life
I've been wonderin' why
Still, somehow I believed
We'd always survive

Now, I'm not so sure 
You're waiting here
One good reason to try 
But what more can I say?
What's left to provide? 

(You think that maybe it's over
Only if you want it to be) 
Are you gonna wait for a sign, your miracle? 
Stand up and fight

(This is it) 
Make no mistake where you are
(This is it) 
Your back's to the corner 
(This is it) 
Don't be a fool anymore
(This is it) 
The waiting is over

No room to run 
No way to hide
No time for wonderin' why
It's here, the moment is now
About to decide

Let 'em believe
Leave him behind
But keep me near in your heart
Know whatever you do
I'm here by your side

(You say that maybe it's over
Not if you don't want it to be) 
For once in your life
Here's your miracle
Stand up and fight

(This is it) 
Make no mistake where you are
(This is it) 
You're goin' no further
(This is it) 
Until it's over and done

(No one can tell you what you know)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Who makes the choice of how it goes)

It's not up to me
This time (you know)
Comes a day in every life

(This is it) 
Make no mistake where you are
(This is it) 
You're goin' no further
(This is it) 
Until it's over and done
(This is it) 
One way or another
(This is it) 
(No one can tell what the future holds) 
(This is it) 
Your back's to the corner
(This is it) 
(You make the choice of how it goes) 
(This is it) 
The waiting is over
(This is it) 
(No one can tell what the future holds) 
(This is it) 
You're going no further
(This is it) 
(You make the choice of how it goes)
