The Spinners: Cupid/I've Loved You For A Long Time
----------------------------------------------------

Cupid - Cupid
Draw back your bow
And let
Your arrow go.
Straight to
My lover's heart for me
Nobody but me.
Cupid
Please hear my cry

And let
Your arrow fly
Straight to
My lover's heart for me.

Now I don't mean to bother you but I'm in distress.
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix.

So cupid
Draw back your bow
...

Now cupid if your arrow makes her love strong for me
I promise I will love her until eternity.
I know between the two of us her heart we can steal

Help me if you will.

So cupid
Draw back your bow
...

Don't you hear me callin'
My tears keep fallin'
I gotta have a lot of nana.

Cupid - Cupid

Look I've loved you for a long time


Now it's time to make you my baby.
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby.
I look at you -
You turn away.
I say to you
Please look my way
But you say to me

Leave it alone

And I say
I can't live without you.
Hey
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby.
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby.
Girl didn't you know that
My love's is for you
And it hurts me so bad
I'm telling you
Come on look at you want.
Try it again

Can't you see I can't live without you.
I've loved you for a long time
Now it's time to make you my baby

Make you my baby.
Cupid
Draw back your bow
And let
You arrow go
Straight to
My lover's heart for me.
Hear me callin'
Hear the love's getting stronger
All I got to do is callin' louder.
Cupid - Cupid
