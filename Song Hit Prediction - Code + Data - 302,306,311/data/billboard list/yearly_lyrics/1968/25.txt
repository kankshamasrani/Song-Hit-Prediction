John Fred And His Playboy Band: Judy In Disguise (With Glasses)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Judy in disguise, well that's what you are
Lemonade pies with your brand new car
Cantalope eyes come to me tonight
Judy in disguise, with glasses

Keep a-wearing your bracelets and your new ra-ra
Cross your heart, yeah, with your live in bra
Chimney sweep sparrow with guise
Judy in disguise, with glasses

Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
Taking everything in sight
Except for the strings on my kite

Judy in disguise, hey that's what you are
Lemonade pies, hey. got your brand new car
Cantalope eyes come to me tonight
Judy in disguise, with glasses

Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
I'm taking everything in sight
Except for the strings of my kite

(Oh, Uh oh, Uhhh)

Judy in disguise, what you aiming for?
A circus of a-horrors, yeah yeah, well that's what you are
You made me a life of ashes
I guess I'll just take your glasses
