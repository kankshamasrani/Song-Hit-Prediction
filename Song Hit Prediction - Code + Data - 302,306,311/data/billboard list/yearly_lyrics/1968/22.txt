The Temptations: I Wish It Would Rain
---------------------------------------

Sunshine, blue skies, please go away
My girl has found another, and gone away
With her went my future, my life is filled with gloom
So day after day, I stay locked up in my room

I know to you it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain 
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside 
(Such a lovely day)
Everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I got to cry, 'cause crying
Eases the pain, oh yeah

People, this hurt I feel inside
Words, they, could never explain
I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Oh let it rain, rain, rain, rain 
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Ooh, baby

Let it rain (rain, rain)
Oh yeah, let it rain

Day in day out, my tear-stained face
Pressed against my window pane
My eyes search the skies, desperately for rain
'Cause rain drops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm crying (crying) crying (crying)
When I go outside

To the world outside
My tears I refuse to explain
Ooh, I wish it would rain
(How I wish that it would rain)
Ooh, baby

Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise
The tears in my eyes

Oh, let it rain
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen
I'm a man and I've got my pride
'Til it rains I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain
