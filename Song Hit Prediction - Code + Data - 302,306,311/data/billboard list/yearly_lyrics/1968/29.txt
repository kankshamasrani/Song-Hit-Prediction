Georgie Fame: The Ballad Of Bonnie And Clyde
----------------------------------------------

Bonnie and Clyde were pretty looking people
But I can tell you people
They were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doing
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way
They robbed a store
And hightailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down

Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
Into the banking business
"Reach for the sky" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag
Now one brave man, he tried to take 'em alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home.

Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun
They used to laugh about dying
But deep inside 'em they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lying
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun
And the morning dew

Acting upon reliable information
A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them

Bonnie and Clyde
They lived a lot together
And finally together
They died
