Jason Derulo: Ridin' Solo
---------------------------

Hm, yea, yea, yea, yea

I'm feelin' like a star, you can't stop my shine,
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky,
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo,
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo.

Yea, I'm feelin' good tonight,
Finally doin' me and it feels so right, oh.
Time to do the things I like,
Goin' to the club, everything's alright, oh.
No one to answer to, no one is goin' to argue, no,
And since I got that hold off me,
I'm livin' life like I'm free, yea.

Told me get my shit together,
Now I got my shit together, yay.
Now I made it through the weather,
Better days are goin' get better.
I'm so sorry, that it didn't work out,
I'm movin' on.
I'm so sorry, but it's over now,
The pain is gone.

I'm puttin' on my shades to cover up my eyes,
I'm jumpin' in my ride, I'm headin' out tonight.
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo,
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo.

I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine,
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky,
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo,
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo.

Now I'm feelin' how I should,
Never knew single could feel this good, oh.
Stop playin' miss understood,
Back in the game, who knew I would, oh.
So flex how I spread my wings,
Lovin' myself makes me want to sing, oh.
Oh yea, yea, yea, yea, yea.

Told me get my shit together,
Now I got my shit together, yay.
Now I made it through the weather,
Better days are goin' get better.
I'm so sorry (sorry), that it didn't work out,
I'm movin' on.
I'm so sorry, but it's over now,
The pain is gone.

I'm puttin' on my shades to cover up my eyes,
I'm jumpin' in my ride, I'm headin' out tonight.
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo,
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo.

I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine,
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky,
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo,
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo.

(Ridin' solo)
Solo
I'm ridin' solo (solo, solo), yea (solo, solo)
It's like S-O-L-O
S-O-L-O
S-O-L-O
I'm livin' my life ain't got stress no more.

I'm puttin' on my shades to cover up my eyes,
I'm jumpin' in my ride, I'm headin' out tonight.
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo,
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo.

I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine,
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky,
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo,
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo.

I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo, oh.
Haha, it's 2009
I'm ridin' solo, solo
I'm ridin' solo, solo.
