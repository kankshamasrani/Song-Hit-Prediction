Clyde McPhatter: A Lover's Question
-------------------------------------

Does she love me, with all her heart
should I worry, when we're apart
it's a lover's question, I'd like to know.

Does she need me, as she pretends
is this a game, well then will I win
it's a lover's question, I'd like to know

I'd like to know when she's not with me
if she's still true to me
I'd like to know when we're kissing
does she feel just what I feel,
and how am I to know it's really real.

Oh, tell me where, the answer lies
is it in her kiss or in her eyes
it's a lover's question I'd like to know.

I'd like to know when she's not with me
if she's still true to me
I'd like to know when we're kissing
does she feel just what I feel,
and how am I to know it's really real.

Oh, tell me where, the answer lies
is it in her kiss or in her eyes
it's a lover's question I'd like to know.
