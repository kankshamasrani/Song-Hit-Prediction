Pat Boone: Remember You're Mine
---------------------------------

(Remember, remember you're mine)

Be faithful, darlin'
While you're away
For when it's summer
A heart can stray

And though I'll miss you
Have a wonderful time
But remember, darlin'
Remember you're mine
(Remember you're mine)

If you go dancin'
And he holds you tight
(And he holds you tight)
And your lips are tempted
On a summer night
(On a summer night)

Your heart beats faster
When the stars start to shine
Just remember, darlin'
Remember you're mine
(Remember you're mine)

I'll be lonely
I'll be blue
But I promise
I'll be true

And though I'll miss you
Have a wonderful time
Just remember, darlin'
Remember you're mine
(Remember you're mine)
