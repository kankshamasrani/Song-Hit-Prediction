Harry Belafonte: Banana Boat (Day-O)
--------------------------------------

Day oh, day oh
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Day is a day, is a day, is a day, is a day, is a day oh
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Work all night, gonna drink our rum
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Stack banana till the morning come
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Come Mister Tally Man, tally me banana
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Come Mister Tally Man, tally me banana
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Lift six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Day is a day oh
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Day is a day, is a day, is a day, is a day
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

A beautiful bunch, a ripe banana
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
I seek deadly lacked a launch-ra
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Lift six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot bunch
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Day is a day oh
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Day is a day, is a day, is a day, is a day
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Come Mister Tally Man, tally me banana
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Come Mister Tally Man, tally me banana
(Till I come and me wanna go home)

Day oh, day oh
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
Day is a day, is a day, is a day, is a day, is a day oh
(Till I come and me wanna go home)
