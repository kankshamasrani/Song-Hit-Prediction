Fats Domino: Valley Of Tears
------------------------------

I want you to take me
Where I belong
Where hearts has been broken
With a kiss and a song

Spend the rest of my day
Without any care
Ev'ryone understands me
In the valley of tears

Soft words has been spoken
So sweet an low
But my mind has made up
Love has got to go

Spend the rest of my day
Without any care
Ev'ryone understand me
In the valley of tears.
