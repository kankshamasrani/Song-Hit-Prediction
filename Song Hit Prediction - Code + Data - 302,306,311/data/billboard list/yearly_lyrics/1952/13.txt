The Four Aces: Tell Me Why
----------------------------

(It is written on the wind)
(It is written on the wind)

A faithless lover's kiss is written on the wind
A night of stolen bliss is written on the wind
Just like the tide leaves
Our dreams we've calmly thrown away
Now they've flown away
{Softly flown away}

The promises we made are whispers in the breeze
They echo and they fade just like our memories
Though you are gone from me
We never can really be apart
What's written on the wind
Is written in my heart

Though you are gone from me
We never can really be apart
What's written on the wind
Is written in my heart

Is written in my heart

(It is written on the wind)
