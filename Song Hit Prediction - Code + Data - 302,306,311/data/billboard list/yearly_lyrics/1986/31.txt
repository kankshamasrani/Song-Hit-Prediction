Billy Ocean: When The Going Gets Tough, The Tough Get Going
-------------------------------------------------------------

When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the going gets tough, the tough get ready
I got something to tell you
I got something to say
I'm gonna put this dream in motion
Never let nothing stand in my way

When the going gets tough, the tough get going
I gonna get myself, cross the river
That's the price I'm willing to pay
I'm gonna make you stand and deliver
And give me love in the old fashioned way
Darling, I'll climb any mountain
Darling, I'll do anything
Oh can I touch you
And do the things that lovers do
Oh wanna hold you
I gotta get it through to you

Darling, I'll do anything
Oh can I touch you
And do the things that lovers do
Oh wanna hold you
I gotta get it through to you

'Cos when the going gets tough, the tough get going
Darling, I'll climb any mountain
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
When the going gets rough, the tough get rough

Oh, baby, I'm gonna buy me a one way ticket
Nothing's gonna hold me back
Your love's like a slow train coming
And I feel it coming down the track

Darling, I'll climb any mountain
Darling, I'll swim any sea
Darling, I'll reach for the heaven
Darling with you lovin' me

Oh can I touch you
And do the things that lovers do
Oh wanna hold you
I gotta get it through to you
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
