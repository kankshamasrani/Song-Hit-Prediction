The Cars: Tonight She Comes
-----------------------------

I know tonight she comes 
She's taking a swipe at fun 
She gives me a reason 
For sighting my sights 
Well, I know tonight she comes

She jangles me up 
She does it with ease 
Sometimes she passes through me 
Just like a breeze 
She gives me a reason 
For feelin' all right 
Oh, well 
(Know tonight, I know tonight) 
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight) 
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight) 
She comes 

And I know she's gonna do it to me 
One more time (One more time) 
I know she's gonna stay implanted 
In my mind 
Why does she keep me hanging on the line, oh 
(Why does she keep me hanging on the line?) 

Ah, yeah, I know she's gonna do it to me 
One more time (One more time) 
I know she's gonna stay implanted 
In my mind 
Oh, why does she keep me hanging on the line?
(Why does she keep me hanging on the line?)
Oh, yeah

I know the way she feels 
And all of the hearts that she steals 
She tells me it's easy 
When you do it right 
Oh, well
Well, I know tonight she comes 
(I know tonight she comes) 

She tells me it's easy 
When you do it right 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight)
She comes

(Know tonight, I know tonight)
I know, oh, yeah
(I know tonight)
Well, I know tonight 
(Know tonight, I know tonight) 
Tonight she comes
