Van Halen: Why Can't This Be Love
-----------------------------------

Whoa, here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch
Hey, I don't know
Oh, tell me where to begin
'Cause I never ever
Felt so much

And I can't recall
Any love at all
Ah baby, this blows 'em all away

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

I tell myself
Hey, only fools rush in
And only time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned if I'll get
Hung up on the line

Hey!
No, I can't recall
Anything at all
Oh, baby this blows them all away
Woo!

It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
You want it straight from the heart 
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

Woo!
It's got what it takes
So tell me why can't this be love?
Straight from my heart
Oh, tell me why can't this be love?

Baby why can't this be love
Got to know why can't this be love?
I wanna know why can't this be love?
