Sheila E.: A Love Bizarre
---------------------------

A B, A B C D 

The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin 
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin 
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams 
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine 

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre 
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre 

A strawberry mind, a body that's built 4 2 
A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do 
Come swallow the pride and joy of the ivory tower 
We'll dance on the roof, make love on a bed of flowers 

The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin 
(It shines down... on... our... skin) 
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin 
(Whispering words that scream of... scream of sin) 
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams 
(We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest... wildest dreams, yeah) 
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine 

That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre 
(A strawberry mind, a body that's built 4 2, me and U) 
That's what we are, we all want a love bizarre 
(A kiss on the spine, we do things we never do) 

What we are, what we are, a love bizarre
What we are, what we are, a love bizarre
What we are (What we are), what we are (what we are) 
A love bizarre (A love bizarre) 

Yeah, yeah, yeah! 

Ah yeah!
