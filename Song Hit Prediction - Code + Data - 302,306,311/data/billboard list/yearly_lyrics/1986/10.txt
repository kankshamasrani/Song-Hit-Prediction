Robert Palmer: Addicted To Love
---------------------------------

The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes

You can't sleep no, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need

Oh, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

You see the signs, but you can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine

A one track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do

Oh, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Addicted to love
You're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Ooh, oh

Your lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats and teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine

Woah, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
You know you're gonna have to face it
You're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it
Might as well face it

Might as well face it
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love

Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
