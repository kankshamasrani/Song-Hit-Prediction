Simple Minds: Alive & Kicking
-------------------------------

You turn me on
You lift me up
Like the sweetest cup
I share with you
You lift me up
Don't you ever stop
I'm here with you
Now it's all or nothing
'Cause you said
You'll follow through
You follow me
And I, I, I follow you

(What you gonna do when things go wrong
What you gonna do when it all cracks up
What you gonna do when the love burns down
What you gonna do when the flames go up
Who is gonna come and turn the tide
What's it gonna take)
To make a dream survive
(Who's got the touch)
To calm a storm inside
(Who's gonna save you)

Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is
Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is
Until your love is
Alive

Oh
You lift me up
To the crucial top
So I can see
Oh
You lead me on
'Til the feelings come
And the lights that shine on
But if that don't mean nothing
Like if someday it should fall through
You take me home
Where the magic's from
And I'll be with you

(What you gonna do when things go wrong
What you gonna do when it all cracks up
What you gonna do when your love burns down
What you gonna do when the flames go up
Who is gonna come and turn the tides
What's it gonna take)
To make a dream survive
(Who's got the touch)
To calm a storm inside

(Don't say goodbye
Don't say goodbye
In the final seconds
Who's gonna save you)

Oooh, oh
Oh

Alive and kicking
Oh
Stay until your love is
Love is
Alive and kicking
Oooh, oh
Oh
(Ba da da da)
Alive and kicking
Oh
Stay until your love is
Love is
(Ba da da da)
Alive and kicking

Oooh, oh
Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is
Alive and kicking
Oh

Alive and kicking

Until it is
(Ba ba da oh
Ba da oh
Ba da da da
Ba ba da da da).
