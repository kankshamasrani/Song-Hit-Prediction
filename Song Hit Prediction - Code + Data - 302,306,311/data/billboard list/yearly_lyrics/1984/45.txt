Chicago: Hard Habit To Break
------------------------------

I guess I thought
You'd be here forever
Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what
You got until it's gone
And I found out too little too late

I was acting as if
You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there

But then you were gone
And it all was wrong
Had no idea
How much I cared

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to

Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take

I'm addicted to you, baby
You're a hard habit to break

You found someone else
You had every reason
You know I can't blame you
For running to him

Two people together
But living alone
I was spreading
My love too thin

After all of these years
I'm still trying to be shaken
Doing much better
They say that it just takes time

But deep in the night
It's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to

Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier
It's the hardest thing to take

I'm addicted to you, baby
You're a hard habit to break

I can't go on, just can't go on
I can't go on, just can't go on

Being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
I don't want to

Being without you
Is all a big mistake
Instead of getting any easier
It's the hardest thing to take

I'm addicted to you
You're a hard habit to break

Just can't go on
(Such a hard habit to break)
Just can't go on
I'm addicted to you

You're a hard habit to break
Just can't go on
(Such a hard habit to break)
I'm addicted to you, baby
