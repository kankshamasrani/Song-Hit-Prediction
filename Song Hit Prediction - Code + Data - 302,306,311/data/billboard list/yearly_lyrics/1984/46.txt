Scandal: The Warrior
----------------------

Oh, oh, oh

You run, run, run away
It's your heart that you'll betray
Feeding on your hungry eyes
I bet you're not so civilized

Where is the love, primitive?
A wild gift that you wanna give
Break out of captivity
And follow me, stereo jungle child
Love is the kill, your heart's still wild

Shootin' at the walls of heartache
Bang, bang
I am the warrior
Well, I am the warrior
And heart to heart you'll win
If you survive
The warrior
The warrior

You talk, talk, talk to me
Your eyes touch me physically
Stay with me, we'll take the night
As passion takes another bite
Oh, oh

Who's the hunter? Who's the game?
I feel the beat call your name
I hold you close in victory
I don't wanna tame your animal style
You won't be caged from the call of the wild

Shootin' at the walls of heartache
Bang, bang
I am the warrior
Well, I am the warrior
And heart to heart you'll win
If you survive
The warrior
The warrior
I am the warrior

Shootin' at the walls of heartache
(Shootin' at the walls of heartache)
The warrior
I am the warrior
And heart to heart you'll win
Heart to heart you'll win
If you survive
The warrior
The warrior

Shootin' at the walls of heartache
Bang, bang
I am the warrior
Yes, I am the warrior
And victory is mine

(Shootin' at the walls of heartache)
The warrior
I am the warrior

Shootin' at the walls of heartache
Bang, bang
I am the warrior
Well, I am the warrior
