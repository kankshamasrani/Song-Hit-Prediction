Steve Perry: Oh Sherrie
-------------------------

You shoulda been gone
Knowing how I made you feel
And I shoulda been gone
After all your words of steel

Oh, I must've been a dreamer (musta been a dreamer, oh)
And I must've been someone else (someone else)
And we should've been over (over by now)

Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on

But I want to let go
You'll go on hurting me
You'd be better off alone
If I'm not who you thought I'd be

But you know that there's a fever (there's a fever, oh)
Oh that you'll never find nowhere else (nowhere else)
Can't you feel it burning on and on (on and on)

Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on

Oh Sherrie

But I shoulda been gone
Long ago, far away
And you shoulda been gone
Now I know just why you stay

Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on

Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on
Oh Sherrie, our love
Holds on, holds on

Hold on
Oh Sherrie
