Buddy Knox: Hula Love
-----------------------

On the isle of Filalilla out Hawai way
A hula maiden gay strolled by a monlit bay
There come a to court her over the water
From a savage Zingazulu land
A Bolo chieftain grand sang her this lay

And he sang
Hulu Hawai hula
Smile on your zing gang a zula
Moon shine above
On your sweet jungle love
For you my bolo is swinging
For you my love song I'm singing
Come be my Hula Hula love

But the chieftain from the peaceful Filalilla land
Would not give him her hand
Her lover took his stand
Through the rattle of the battle
As she heard his sweet voice calm and true
They fled in his canoe over water blue

And he sang
Hulu Hawai hula
Smile on your zing gang a zula
Moon shine above
On your sweet jungle love
For you my bolo is swinging
For you my love song I'm singing
Come be my Hula Hula love
