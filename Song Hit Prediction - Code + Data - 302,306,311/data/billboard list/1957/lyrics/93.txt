Patience & Prudence: Gonna Get Along Without Ya Now
-----------------------------------------------------

Mm-hum, mm-hum, gonna get along without you now
Mm-hum, my honey, mm-hum, my honey
Gonna get along without you now
You told me I was the neatest thing
You even asked me to wear your ring
Then you ran around with every girl in town
You never cared if it got me down
Mm-hum, mm-hum, gonna get along without you now
Mm-hum, my honey, mm-hum, my honey
Gonna get along without you now

(Instrumental Interlude)

Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find somebody who's twice as cute
'Cause I didn't like you anyhow
You told everybody that we were friends
But this is where our friendship ends
All of a sudden you changed your tune
You haven't been around since way last June
Mn-hum, mm-hum, gonna get along without you now
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
So long, my honey
Goodbye, my dear
Gonna get along
