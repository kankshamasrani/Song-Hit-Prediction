Ricky Nelson: Be-Bop Baby
---------------------------

A-Be-bop baby
A-Be-bop baby
A-Be-bop baby
She's the gal for me-ee

She got plenty of rhythm, got plenty of jive
And when we dance it really comes alive
My love for her's so tender and sweet
My heart starts poundin' ev'ry time we meet
A-Be-bop baby still in her teens
just as sweet as she can be-ee-ee
A-Be-bop baby in her old blue jeans
Is the be-bop baby for me-ee
A-Be-bop baby for me

A-Be-bop baby
A-Be-bop baby
A-Be-bop baby
She's the gal for me-ee

I'm gonna find 'er tonight
We're gonna have a time
I want that baby to be mine, all mine
A big day's comin' for my baby and me
The day she says she belongs to me
A-Be-bop baby still in her teens
just as sweet as she can be-ee-ee
A-Be-bop baby in her old blue jeans
is the be-bop baby for me-ee
A-Be-bop baby for me

A-Be-bop baby
A-Be-bop baby
A-Be-bop baby
She's the gal for me-ee

I'm gonna find 'er tonight
we're gonna have a time
I want that baby to be mine, all mine
A big day's comin' for my baby and me
The day she says she belongs to me
A-Be-bop baby still in her teens
Just as sweet as she can be-ee-ee
A-Be-bop baby in her old blue jeans
Is the be-bop baby for me-ee
A-Be-bop baby for me
