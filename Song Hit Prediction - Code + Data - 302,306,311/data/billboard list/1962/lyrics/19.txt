Mary Wells: The One Who Really Loves You
------------------------------------------

Some other girls are filling your head with jive
So, now you're acting like you don't know I'm alive

Love, you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you

Suzie, only wants you until the day
(Only wants you until the day)
That she'll again have her true love
Who's far, far, away
(Her true love who's far away)

(Wake up)
So, love you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)

Ginny only wants you,
'Cause she thinks she has to have everyone
Minnie, only wants you
'Cause she thinks that hurting me would be fun
Oh, oh, oh

Silly Lilly, you know she doesn't really
Want you with a love that's true
In fact, there's no other girl
In this whole wide world
Who can love you like I do

They get tired of you
Then they're gonna put ya down
(Put you down, put you down)
They ain't gonna want you hangin' around
(Hangin' around, hangin' around)

(Wake up)
So, love you better wake up
Yeah, before we break up
And you lose me, little me
The one who really loves you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)

I-I-I do (yeah-yeah)
Really, really, love you
(I really love you, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-ooh (yeah-yeah)
