Dion: The Wanderer
--------------------

Oh, well, I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are, well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love 'em 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em, they don't even know my name

They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around

Oh, well, there's Flo on my left arm, and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl, well, that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I'll tear open my shirt, and I show her Rosie on my chest

'Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around

Oh, well, I roam-a from town to town
I go through life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
A-with my two fists of iron, but I'm going nowhere

Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself fallin' for some girl
Yeah, I hop right into that car of mine, I drive around the world

Yeah, I'm a wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around
Let's go, yeah

Oh yeah, I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place, I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine, drive around the world

'Cause I'm a wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around

'Cause I'm a wanderer
Yeah, a wanderer
I roam around, around, around, around, around, around, around

'Cause I'm a wanderer
