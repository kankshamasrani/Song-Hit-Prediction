The New Seekers: I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing
------------------------------------------------------

I'd like to build a world a home
And furnish it with love
Grow apple trees and honey bees
And snow white turtle doves

I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company

I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace throughout the land

That's the song I hear
Let the world sing today
A song of peace that echoes on
And never goes away

I'd like to teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
I'd like to hold it in my arms
And keep it company

I'd like to see the world for once
All standing hand in hand
And hear them echo through the hills
For peace throughout the land

That's the song I hear
Let the world sing today
A song of peace that echoes on
And never goes away
A song of peace that echoes on
And never goes away
