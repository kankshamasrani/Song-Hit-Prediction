Stephen Schwartz: Day By Day
------------------------------

(Robin)
Day by day, 
Day by day, 
Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray.
To see thee more clearly, 
Love thee more dearly,
Follow thee more nearly, 
Day by day.

Day by day, 
Day by day, 
Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray.
To see thee more clearly, 
Love thee more dearly,
Follow thee more nearly, 
Day by day.

(All)
Day by day, 
Day by day, 
Oh, dear Lord, three things I pray.
To see thee more clearly, 
Love thee more dearly,
Follow thee more nearly, 
Day by day.
(repeats)

Day by day,
Day by day,
Day by day,
Day by day,
Day by day,
Day by day,
Day by day. (etc)
