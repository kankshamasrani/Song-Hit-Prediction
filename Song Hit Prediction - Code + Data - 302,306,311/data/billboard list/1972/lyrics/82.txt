Curtis Mayfield: Freddie's Dead
---------------------------------

Freddie's dead
That's what I said
Let the man rap a plan, said he'd send him home
But his hope was a rope, and he should have known

Everybody's misused him, ripped him off and abused him
Another junkie playin', pushin' dope for the man
A terrible blow, but that's how it go
Freddie's on the corner now, if you wanna be a junkie, wow
Remember, Freddie's dead

We're all built up with progress
But sometimes I must confess
We can deal with rockets and dreams
But reality, what does it mean? Ain't nothing said

'Cause Freddie's dead
Hey, hey
Love, love
Huh huh
Love, love
Hey, hey
Huh huh
Yeah, yeah
Freddie's dead

All I want is some peace of mind
With a little love I'm trying to find
This could be such a beautiful world with a wonderful girl
Why I need a woman child, don't wanna be like freddie now

'Cause freddie's dead
Everybody's misused him, ripped him off and abused him
Another junkie playin', pushin' dope for the man
Freddie's on the corner now, if you wanna be a junkie, wow
Remember, Freddie's dead

Huh huh
Huh huh
Freddie's dead
