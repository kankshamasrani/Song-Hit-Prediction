Neil Sedaka: Laughter In The Rain
-----------------------------------

Strolling along country roads with my baby
It starts to rain, it begins to pour
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin
I feel a shiver run up my spine
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

After awhile we run under a tree (after awhile)
I turn to her and she kisses me
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves (there with the beat)
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes
Sharing our love under stormy skies

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

I feel the warmth of her hand in mine

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside

Ooo, I hear laughter in the rain
Walking hand in hand with the one I love
Ooo, how I love the rainy days and the happy way
I feel inside
