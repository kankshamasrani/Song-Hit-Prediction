Carol Douglas: Doctor's Orders
--------------------------------

[Phone ringing over the instrumental intro]

[Spoken over the instrumental intro]:

[Caller]:
Hello?

[Carol Douglas]:
Hi, honey, it's me.
I went to see the doctor today
'Cause ever since you've been gone....

[Female background vocal group singing]:
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[over Carol Douglas speaking like Diana Ross
during the instrumental break]:
I've had a pain deep down inside
He said there's nothing really wrong with me
I'm just missing my man,
So, honey, please come on home as soon as you can.

[Sung]:
Doctor's orders say there's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 'cause only you can cure me
Says in my condition love's the best physician
He prescribed a potion full of warm emotion

Every day
A loving spoonful to be taken
It's the only way
To stop this empty heart of mine from breaking

Won't get better till you're back again he told me
Doctor's orders need your loving arms to hold me
Darling now I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm so hooked on your love I can't live without it

You're away
But please don't treat me like a stranger
Doctor's orders say
One kiss from you and I am out of danger

[Female background vocal group singing]:
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey, hey, hey)

[over Carol Douglas once again speaking like Diana Ross
during the instrumental interlude]:
Please say you understand how I feel, honey
I know you've got a lot of things on your mind
Oh, but I'm missing you so bad
Please, oh, please come on home

[Sung]:
Doctor's orders say there's only one thing for me
Nothing he can do 'cause only you can cure me
Says in my condition love's the best physician
He prescribed a potion full of warm emotion

Darling, now, I know there ain't no doubt about it
I'm so hooked on your love
I can't live without it
