Toby Keith: Red Solo Cup
--------------------------

Now, red Solo cup is the best receptical
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicles
If you prefer drinkin' from glass

Hey, red Solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years, they are decomposable
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
Freddy Mac can kiss my ass

Whoo!

Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party

I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky

But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
On them to help me get lucky

Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party

I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party

Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
'Cause you are the Abbot to my Costello
And you are the Fruit to my Loom

Red Solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
When I look at you and say

Red Solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no!)
You're my-you're my (friend?) friend
(Friend, friend, friend, life-long)
Thank you for being my friend

Red Solo cup
I fill you up
Let's have a party
Let's have a party

I love you, red Solo cup
I lift you up
Proceed to party
Proceed to party
