Gym Class Heroes: Stereo Hearts
---------------------------------

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote

Make me your radio (yeah, a-ha)
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo
(Gym Class Heroes baby!)

If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like get Rihanna, chicka, Travie, I can handle that

Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you
Heh heh heh

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote (Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on)

Make me your radio (Uh huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo (Let's go)

If I was an old school fifty-pound boombox ('member them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop?

And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate

I think finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hear this, sing along and take me by the hands
Keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart is a stereo that only plays for you

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note
O-oh

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

I only pray you'll never leave me behind
Because good music can be so hard to find
I'll take your hand and hold it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-o-ote

Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
So sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh, so sing along to my stereo

It's ya boy Travie
Gym Class Heroes, baby!

So sing along to my stereo

Yeah!
