Carrie Underwood: Good Girl
-----------------------------

Hey, good girl with your head in the clouds
I bet you I can tell you what you're thinkin' about
You'll see a good boy, gonna give you the world
But he's gonna leave you cryin' with your heart in the dirt

His lips are dripping honey but he'll sting you like a bee
So lock up all your loving, go and throw away the key
Hey good girl, get out while you can
I know you think you got a good man

Why, why you gotta be so blind, won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find, he's no good, girl
No good for you, you better get to getting on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go, better listen to me, he's low, low, low

Hey, good girl, you got a heart of gold
You want a white wedding and a hand you can hold
Just like you should, girl, like every good girl does
Want a fairytale ending, somebody to love

But he's really good at lying, yeah, he'll leave you in the dust
'Cause when he says forever, well, it don't mean much
Hey good girl, so good for him
Better back away honey, you don't know where he's been

Why, why you gotta be so blind, won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find, he's no good, girl
No good for you, you better get to getting on your goodbye shoes
And go, go, go, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's low, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, he's no good, girl, why can't you see
He'll take your heart and break it, listen to me, yeah

Why, why you gotta be so blind, won't you open up your eyes
It's just a matter of time 'til you find, he's no good, he's no good
Won't you open up your eyes, it's just a matter of time 'til you find
He's no good, girl, no good for you

You better get to getting on
Your goodbye shoes
