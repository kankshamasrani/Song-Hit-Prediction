Perry Como: Juke Box Baby
---------------------------

( un-edited version )

Ah! when my jukebox baby takes the floor  
'round the old jukebox in the candy store  
the joint starts jumpin' till the roof comes tumblin' down! 

( Choo-choo-wah, choo-choo-wah,  
shooby-doo-wah! )  

Jukebox baby,  
you're the swingin'est doll in town!    

( Jukebox baby! ) Put a nickel in for Maybelline  
( Jukebox baby! ) drop another one for seventeen  
( Jukebox baby! ) whisper to your daddy-o  
three little love words ( Ko-ko-mo! )    

How ya gonna get your homework done  
when you keep that jukebox on the run? 
You don't dig Latin like ya dig that crazy sound  

( Choo-choo-wah, choo-choo-wah,  
shooby-doo-wah )  

Hmmm . . .  
Jukebox baby . . .  
you're the swingin'est doll in town!    

( Jukebox baby! ) I hear you knockin'  
( Jukebox baby! ) Keep the coin box hoppin'  
( Jukebox baby! ) Tell me sincerely  
That you ain't forgettin' no " Tina Marie"    

( Hip-hip, hop-hop, ho-ho, hah hah! )    

Oh! jukebox baby . . .   
my jukebox baby . . .  
jukebox baby! 

( Ju-jukebox baby . . .   jukebox baby . . .  
jukebox baby! ) 

All your lunch time money goes down the slot  
You could live on air if the music's hot  
You just ain't quittin' till ya rock that clock around! 

( Choo-choo-wah, choo-choo-wah,  
shooby-doo-wah )  

Da de dah de dah! . . .  
Jukebox baby . . .  
you're the swingin'est doll in town!    

Hah!! . . . [ ( Jukebox baby! ) 
You're a "chick" and there's a cutie . . . 
always singin' "Tutti-Frutti"  . . . ]  

( See ya later! . . . Alligator! )  

Oh! hey, wing-a-dinga  
what a dungaree doll I've found! 

Well then there now . . .  
Jukebox baby . . .  jukebox baby! 

You're the wingin'est, dingin'est,  
swingin'est "doll" in town!
