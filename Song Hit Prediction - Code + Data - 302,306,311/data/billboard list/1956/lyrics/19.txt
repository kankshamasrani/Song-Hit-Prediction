Jim Lowe: The Green Door
--------------------------

(Midnight one more night without sleepin'
Watchin' 'til the mornin' comes creepin'
Green door what's that secret you're keepin'?)

There's an old piano
And they play it hot
Behind the green door
Don't know what they're doin'
But they laugh a lot
Behind the green door
Wish they'd let me in
So I could find out
What's behind the green door

(Knocked once
Tried to tell 'em I've been there
Door slammed
Hospitality's thin there
Wonder just what's goin' on in there)

Saw an eyeball peepin'
Through a smoky cloud
Behind the green door
When I said Joe sent me
Someone laughed out loud
Behind the green door
All I want to do is join the happy crowd
Behind the green door

(Interlude)

(Midnight one more night without sleepin'
Watchin' 'til the mornin' comes creepin'
Green door what's that secret you're keepin'?
Green door what's that secret you're keepin'?
Green door)
