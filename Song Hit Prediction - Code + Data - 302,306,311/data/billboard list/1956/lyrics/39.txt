Perry Como: More
------------------

You're more than life to me, 
More than eternity . . . 
And the more I know of you, 
All the more I love you . . . 

I need you more each day, 
Much more than words can say. . . 
More than forevermore, 
I'll be yours. . . 

The silver moon will fade too soon, 
And bring the dawn when you'll be gone . . . 
Before you go, please let me know, 
That what you feel is really real . . . 

So do not grieve that I must leave, 
Because I live only for, 
Your love an' mine, 
More and more! 

( repeat first two verses ) 

More than forevermore, 
I'll be yours!
