Patti Page: Mama From The Train
---------------------------------

Throw mama from the train a kiss, a kiss
Wave mama from the train a goodbye
Throw mama from the train a kiss a kiss
And don't cry, my baby, don't cry

How I miss that sweet lady with her old-country touch
Miss her quaint broken English called *Pennsylvania Dutch*
I can still see her there at the station that day
Calling out to her baby as the train pulled away

Throw mama from the train a kiss, a kiss
Dry mama all your tears, won't you try?
Throw mama from the train a kiss, a kiss
And eat mama up all her pie

Can't believe that she's gone now, it's a lonely old town
Yet I know that her heavenly love keeps looking down
'cause whenever I happen to be passing through
I could swear she was there with the warmth I once knew

And I
Throw mama from the train a kiss, a kiss
Wave mama from the train a goodbye
Throw mama from the train a kiss, a kiss
And she throws one back from up high
