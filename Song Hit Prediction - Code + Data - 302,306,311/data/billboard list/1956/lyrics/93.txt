Clyde McPhatter: Treasure Of Love
-----------------------------------

A treasure of love, is easy to find
It's waiting for you, if your hear,ar,art isn't blind
A treasure of love, is not very far
It glows like fire and it shi-i-ines, like a star

It's stronger than diamonds and worth more than gold
This is a treasure that never grows old
The treasure of love is found on no chart
To find where it is just look in your heart

It's stronger than diamonds and worth more than gold
This is a treasure that never grows old
The treasure of love is found on no chart
To find where it is just lo-a-ook in your heart
