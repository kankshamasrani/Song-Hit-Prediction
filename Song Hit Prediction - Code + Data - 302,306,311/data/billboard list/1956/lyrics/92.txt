Fats Domino: My Blue Heaven
-----------------------------

Day is ending
Birds are wending
Back to the shelter of
Each little nest they love

Nightshades falling
Lovebirds calling
What makes the world go round?
Nothing but love

When Whip-poor-wills call
And ev'ning is nigh
I hurry to 
My blue heaven

I turn to the right
A little white light
Will lead you to 
My blue heaven

You'll see a smiling face,
A fireplace, 
A cozy room
A little nest 
That's nestled where 
The roses bloom

Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three;
We're happy in 
My blue heaven

Doo doo doo doo doo
Da da da da da

You'll see a smiling face
A fireplace, 
A cozy room
A little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom

Just Mollie and me
And baby makes three;
We're happy in 
My blue heaven

We're happy in my blue heaven
