Ocean: Put Your Hand In The Hand
----------------------------------

Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

Every time I look into the Holy Book I want to tremble (tremble)
Or when I read about the part where the carpenter cleared the temple (temple)
For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellas than what I profess to be
And it causes me shame to know we're not the people we should be

So, put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

My mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
She said, "there'll come a time when there'll probably be room in heaven"
But I'm feeling kinda guilty 'bout the number of times to do what we must do
But we forget what he said, then we figure that he'll still make room

So, you gotta put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at others differently
By puttin' your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

Everybody come along

Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the water
(Who stilled the water)
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
(Who calmed the sea)
Take a look at yourself and you can look at
