Lobo: Me And You And A Dog Named Boo
--------------------------------------

I remember to this day
The bright red Georgia clay
How it stuck to the tires after the summer rain
Willpower made that old car go
A women's mind told me that's so
Oh how I wish we were back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

I can still recall
The wheat fields of Saint Paul
And the morning we got caught robbing from an old hen
Old MacDonald, he made us work
But then he paid us for what it was worth
Another tank of gas and back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

I'll never forget the day
We motored stately into big L.A.
The lights of the city put settling down in my brain
Though it's only been a month or so
That old car's bugging us to go
We gotta get away and get back on the road again

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man

Me and you and a dog named Boo
Travelling and a-living off the land
Me and you and a dog named Boo
How I love being a free man
