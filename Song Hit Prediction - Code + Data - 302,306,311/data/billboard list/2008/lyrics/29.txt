Kardinal Offishall: Dangerous
-------------------------------

Akon:
Girl I can notice but to
Notice you
Noticin' me
From across the room

I can see it that can't stop myself from lookin'
And noticin' you noticin' me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous

That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before she's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

Kardinal Offishall:
Oh, yeah that's her
The big dog tryin' to get her little kitty to purr
Next man lookin' at me like I'm Lucifer
'Cause he knows I will deal with the case, yes sir
If I was the last man I earth, I would only take that girl, end the search

She'll give a new definition to the word curve
Got chicks in the strip club, envyin' hers
Bodies like what is a mass irruptions, sit the glass on that fat obstruction
Tongue game give a new type seduction, I'm tryin' to get back her something

Akon:
Girl I can notice but to
Notice you
Noticin' me
From across the room
I can see it that can't stop myself from lookin'

And noticin', you noticin' me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous

That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before she's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

Kardinal Offishall:
Oh bad to the bone, everything locked like a two, three zone
I wanna make my black snake moan
Talk a little bit then take that off
She's bad and she know the deal
That's what I can't hide when she wanna conceal, I mean

Makin' good and havin' big
Put together and close to the jibby, I see
No! No!
No disrespect, but this killer from another level, cut the check

Aw.
Tell King Mac stop the press
Say kid, can I get a witness?

Akon:
Girl I can notice but to
Notice you
Noticin' me
From across the room

I can see it that can't stop myself from lookin'
And noticin' you noticin' me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous

That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before she's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah

I see you got that fire by the way that your walkin'
From left to right I watched her go down
Girl I just want it right now don't wanna do no talkin'
Shawty's so right I need to slow down

Kardinal Offishall:
Figure 8
Good body shape
When she on the dance floor, tell 'em I rip
When she do her thing man, can't watch shit
That beat soak up everything our grib

Bad heels like Jessica P
I'm tryin' to give homegirl sex and the cit-tit-tit-tity
Itty bitty waistline moves with the baseline
One look, I'll punch, I'm fine!

Akon:
Girl I can notice but to
Notice you
Noticin' me
From across the room

I can see it that can't stop myself from lookin'
And noticin' you noticin' me
Watch out I've seen her type before
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous

That girl is a bad girl
I've seen her type before she's so dangerous
That girl is so dangerous
That girl is a bad girl, yeah
