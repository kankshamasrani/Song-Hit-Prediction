J. Holiday: Suffocate
-----------------------

Now even though I try to play it off.
Im thinking bout you all day long and
I cant wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
my hands on your hips when we grind im fantazing
Bout what im gon do to you.
You got me fiending for her love ( can't lie)
Man you should see how she got me
Spending all this time with her (with her)
And I couldnt leave her if I wanted to her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do.

Chorus(2x)
Cause I cant breathe when you talk to me,
Cant breathe when your touching me
Suffocate when your away from me
So much love you take from me
Im going out of my mind

Whenever we up in this bed and my fingers all in your hair,
I Wonder if you feel me watching you
Cause I can't go a night without your lovin
Got me lookin at this phone
Everytime it rings I hope its you (girl)
Got me bracin through ur love (and i) 
Ive fallen for u I (cant lie) 
I just wanna be with u


And yes she got me there I said it
Somebody call the paramedics tell them to hurry up and come through.

Chorus(x2)
Cause I cant breathe (cant breathe) when u talk to me
I cant breathe when ur touching me (when your touching me)
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
Im going out of my mind

Dont never leave me girl 
I need you inside my world 
I cant go a day without you 
And see nobody else will ever do I'll never feel like I feel with you cause

I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touching me
I Suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
Im going out of my mind ( im going out of my mind)

I cant breathe when you talk to me( I cant breathe)
i cant breathe when your touchin me
I Suffocate when you're away from me so much love you take from me.
Im going out of my mind (im going out of my mind).Ouhh no no .. I cant breathe . ouhh no no I cant breathe ouhh no no I cant breathe .ohhhhhh woo ouhh

Ooo no no I cant breathe Ooo no no I cant breathe ( I cant breathe).
