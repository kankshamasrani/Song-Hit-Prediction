Her man started muggin' (muggin)
He could see it in my eyes

Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keep them heels on high, (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go (I love your girl)

She run her fingers through her hair, you try to call her over there
But she like, Fuck! That nigga!
She droppin' down to the floor, I'm like shorty you should go,

And I pray that y'all ain't serious, cause seriously she's on my dick.

(Chorus:)
