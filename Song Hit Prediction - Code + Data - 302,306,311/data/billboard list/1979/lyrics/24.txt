Maxine Nightingale: Lead Me On
--------------------------------

I have often heard you say you love me as a friend
But I love you more than anyone
You know I can't pretend no longer
I would give you anything
I'd throw my world away
But you don't wanna hear that anymore
And you wanna hear me say

Come on and lead me on
Come on and tease me all night long
Loving you, I know it's right
I'll always need you
I'll never leave you
Come on and lead me on
Tease me all night long
I'd rather be a fool with a broken heart
Than someone who never had a part of you

You know I told you from the start exactly how I feel
Time goes on
It seems nothing's changed
I'm in love for real
We have never played the games that real lovers do
So maybe we are better off
But baby, I'd still like this from you

Come on and lead me on
Come on and tease me all night long
Loving you, I know it's right
I'll always need you
I'll never leave you
Come on and lead me on
Tease me all night long
I'd rather be a fool with a broken heart
Than someone who never had a part of you
