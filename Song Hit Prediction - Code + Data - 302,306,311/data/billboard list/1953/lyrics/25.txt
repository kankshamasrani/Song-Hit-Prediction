Joni James: Why Don't You Believe Me
--------------------------------------

Why don't you believe me?
It's you I adore
Forever and ever, can I promise more?
I've told you so often the way that I care
Why don't you believe me?
It just isn't fair

[Chorus:]
Here is a heart that is lonely
Here is a heart you can take
Here is a heart for you only
That you can keep or break

How else can I tell you, what more can I do?
Why don't you believe me?, I love only you

[Chorus]
