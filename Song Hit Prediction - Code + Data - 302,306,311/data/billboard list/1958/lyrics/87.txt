Pat Boone: Sugar Moon
-----------------------

Oh sugar moon
come out tonight

bring me your glow
of angel light

here in my arms
a love will bloom
if you will shine.

Oh sugar moon
while you shine down
from up above
I'll hold her close
and talk sweet love.
And in your glow
we'll hear love's tune
then she'll be mine

oh
sugar moon.
