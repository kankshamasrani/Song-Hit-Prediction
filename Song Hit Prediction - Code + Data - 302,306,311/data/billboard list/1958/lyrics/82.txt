Pat Boone: It's Too Soon To Know
----------------------------------

Does she love me? It's too soon to know
Can I believe her when she tells me so?
Is she foolin'? Is it all a game?
Am I the fire or just another flame?
A one-sided love would break my heart
She may be just acting and playing a part

If she don't love me let her tell me so
I won't hold her if she wants to go
Though I'll cry when she's gone
I won't die, I'll live on
If it's so, it's too soon, way too soon to know

If she don't love me let her tell me so
I can't hold her if she wants to go
Though I'll cry when she's gone
I won't die, I'll live on
If it's so, it's too soon, way too soon to know
