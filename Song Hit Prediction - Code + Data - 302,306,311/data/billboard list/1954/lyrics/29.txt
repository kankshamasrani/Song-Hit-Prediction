The Four Aces: Stranger In Paradise
-------------------------------------

Take my hand
I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
A stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
That's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside an angel like you

I saw your face and I ascended
Out of the commonplace into the rare
Somewhere in space I hang suspended
Until I know there's a chance that you care

Won't you answer the fervent prayer
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for

But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no more

Take my hand
