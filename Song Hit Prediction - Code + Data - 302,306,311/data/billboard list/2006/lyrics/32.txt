Christina Aguilera: Ain't No Other Man
----------------------------------------

Heyeyey, yeaheaheahea!

(Do your thang, honey!)

I could feel it from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something about you caught my eye
Something moved me deep inside

Don't know what you did, boy, but you had it
And I've been hooked ever since

I told my mother, my brother, my sister and my friend
Told the others, my lovers, both past and present tense
That every time I see you everything starts making sense

(Do your thang, honey!)

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (What you do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, shake your badass, oh yeah!

Ain't no other man, it's true, alright
Ain't no other man but you

Never thought I'd be alright, no, no, no
'Till you came into my life, yeah, yeah, yeah
World was cloudy, now it's clear, yeah
Your the life that I needed

You got what I want boy and I want it
So keep on givin' it up! 

So tell your mother, your brother, your sister and your friends
Tell the others, your lovers, better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no-one else's
Ohoho

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (Do)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, shake your badass, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Ain't no other man, it's true, alright
Ain't no other man but you

(Break it down now)

Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other, other
Ain't no other, ain't, ain't no other lover
Ain't no other, I, I, I need no other
Ain't no other man but you, ohoho

You are there when I'm a mess
Talked me down from every ledge
Give me strength, boy, you're the best
You're the only one who's ever passed every test

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (Next to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (Oooh)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, shake your badass, oh yeah

Ain't no other man, it's true, alright
Ain't no other man but you
And now I'm telling you there ain't no other man but you

Ain't no other man can stand up next to you (Next to you)
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do (Oooh)
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon
You got soul, you got class, you got style, shake your badass, oh yeah

Ain't no other man, it's true
Ain't no other man but you
