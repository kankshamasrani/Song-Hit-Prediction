Chris Brown: Run It!
----------------------

Okay , check it, check it, check it out 
It's Santana again , steppin', steppin', steppin' out 
One of them brand new big boy toys 
I do big boy things , I make big boy noise 'cause

I know what girls want (what?)
I know what they like (like)
They wanna stay up
And party all night, so bring a friend 

Let me talk to you
Tell you how it is
I was thinkin' when I saw that body gotta get shawty
Tell her what the young boy gon' do

Damn, them chicks with you
Gotta be okay
Babe, pretty thick wit the kick that's sick that need to be hit
So tell me what y'all gon' do

I got friends and you got friends
They hop out and you hop in
I look fly and they jockin'
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop, pop

I got friends and you got friends
They hop out and you hop in
I look fly and they jockin'
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop, pop

Is your man on the floor?
If he ain't let me know
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it

Is your man on the floor?
If he ain't let me know
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it, c'mere

You'll see, girl, I can set you off
Don't believe my age is gonna slow us down
I can definitely show you things
That's gonna have you sayin' I can't be 16

Once I get in you won't wanna go
(And I) I'll have yo girls wishin' they were you
(And I) I know your heard about me
But guess what's goin' down if we leave

I got friends and you got friends
They hop out and you hop in
I look fly and they jockin'
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop, pop

I got friends and you got friends
They hop out and you hop in
I look fly and they jockin'
The way you drop, drop makes me wanna pop, pop

Is your man on the floor?
If he ain't let me know
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it

Is your man on the floor?
If he ain't let me know
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it, let's go

Girl, you feel right (feel right)
Make me feel like (feel like)
I wanna do a little somethin' (do a little somethin')
Ain't no thing let you do it for sure

Girl, the way that your wearin' them jeans is turnin' me on
I'm the hottest thing that's in these streets
So, baby, won't you rock me?

Make it drop honey
Make it pop honey
Whip, whop
Tick, tock to that clock for me
Don't stop doing that
And shorty know I mean what I say so she won't stop doing that

Plus I heard if you can dance you can bump
Well dance, time is up, let's go, let's go (yup)
We can get it in
We can gets some friends
Do it like the ying yang twins and start whispering
Wait till you see my...
Wait till you see my...

Let me fall back
You ain't ready for all that
Have you sleep late, real late, yeah taking a long nap
You tell your friends...
To get with my friends
We can be friends
Switch and meet friends (switch)
We can do it all night long, and
Till that clock hit morning, ya dig

Is your man on the floor?
If he ain't let me know
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it

Is your man on the floor?
If he ain't let me know
Let me see if you can run it, run it
Girl, indeed I can run it, run it
