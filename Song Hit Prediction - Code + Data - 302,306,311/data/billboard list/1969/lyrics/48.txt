The Grass Roots: I'd Wait A Million Years
-------------------------------------------

All of the lonely nights
Waiting for you to come
Longing to hold you tight
I need you so desperately
Waiting for you to come
Bringing your love to me 

But I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

As life is reality
When you are near to me
I am in ecstasy (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I'd swallow the pain and pride
Baby, I just can't hide
All that I feel inside 

And I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

A million years
I would wait for you
A million tears
Baby, I'd be true
A million miles
I would follow you
A million years
If you want me to

Pacing the floor, detest
Sweat pouring down my chest
Still I can't love you less (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
It's worth all the pain and pride
Baby, I just cant hide
All that I feel inside 

And I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me

I'd wait a million years
Walk a million miles
Cry a million tears (Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I'd swim the deepest sea
Climb the highest hill
Just to have you near me
