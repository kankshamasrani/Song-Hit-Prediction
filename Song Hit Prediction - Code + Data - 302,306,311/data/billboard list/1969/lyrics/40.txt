Fifth Dimension: Wedding Bell Blues
-------------------------------------

Bill, I love you so, I always will
I look at you and see the passion eyes of May
Oh but am I ever gonna see my wedding day?

I was on your side Bill, when you were losing
I'd never scheme or lie Bill, there's been no fooling
But kisses and love won't carry me 'til you marry me, Bill

I love you so, I always will
And in your voice, I hear a choir of carousels
Oh but am I ever gonna hear my wedding bells?

I was the one who came running when you were lonely
I haven't lived one day not loving you only
But kisses and love won't carry me 'til you marry me, Bill

I love you so, I always will
And though devotion rules my heart, I take no vows
But Bill, you're never gonna take those wedding vows

Oh, come on, Bill, oh, come on, Bill
Come on and marry me, Bill
I got the wedding bell blues, please marry me, Bill
I got the wedding bell blues, marry me, Bill
