Jessica Simpson: With You
---------------------------

The real me is a southern girl
With her Levis on and an open heart
Wish I could save the world
Like I was Supergirl

The real me used to laugh all night
Lyin in the grass just talkin' bout love
But lately I've been jaded
Life got so complicated

I start thinkin' about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know what love feels like

But with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me
Right before I hit the ground

With nothin' but a t-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke 
Just meant for us to know

I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me

Cuz' I start thinkin' about it
I almost forgot what it was like
To know when it feels right

Cuz' with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me
Right before I hit the ground

With nothin' but a t-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you

With you with you with you

Come and take me
Love you, save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself with you

I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me
Right before I hit the ground

With nothin' but a t-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
