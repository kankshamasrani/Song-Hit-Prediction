Kanye West: Through The Wire
------------------------------

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
Yo Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they? Can they, Hop?
I spit it through the wire, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man (For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all)
I'd gladly risk it all right now (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
It's a life-or-death situation, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now
It's your boy Kanye to the, Chi-town, what's goin' on? (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Uh huh, yeah, yeah

Kanye West:
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her her son's on life support and just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin to be lyin', I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
I really apologize for everything right now, if it's unclear at all, man (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
Y'know he had reconstru- I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
I looked in the mirror and half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man, this what I got to say right here, dawg (Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

Kanye West:
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory and what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time in the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt, you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dogs couldn't tell if I, I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like Geico
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel 'cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what you thought, they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys-R-Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Kanye West and Chaka Khan:
Y'know what I'm saying? (Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall)
When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said (For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all)
"Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?
It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!" Haha (Through the fire, through whatever come my way)
She can't be serious, man (For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way)
(Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
