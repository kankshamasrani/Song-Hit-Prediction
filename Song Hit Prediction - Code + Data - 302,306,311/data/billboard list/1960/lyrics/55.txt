Jimmy Charles: A Million To One
---------------------------------

A million to one
That's what our folks think about this love of ours
A million to one
They say that our love will fade like yesterday's flowers

They're betting everything that our love won't survive
They're hoping
(Hoping)
In time we'll forget
Each others' lies

A million to one
They feel we're too young to know the meaning of love
A million to one
That they've forgotten the dreams that we're dreaming of

But we'll forgive them because we love them
After all is said and done
Dear one, in a million, a million to one

(But we'll forgive them because we love them)
After all is said and done
Dear one, in a million, a million to one
