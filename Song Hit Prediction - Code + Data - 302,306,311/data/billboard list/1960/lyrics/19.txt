Brian Hyland: Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini
----------------------------------------------------------------

Bop bop bop bop bopopopopopopop

She was afraid to come out of the locker
She was as nervous as she could be
She was afraid to come out of the locker
She was afraid that somebody would see

Two three four
Tell the people what she wore

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini
That she wore for the first time today
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini
So in the locker, she wanted to stay

Two three four
Stick around we'll tell you more
Bop bop bop bop bopopopopopopop

She was afraid to come out in the open (badadup)
And so a blanket around her she wore (badadup)
She was afraid to come out in the open (badadup)
And so she sat, bundled up on the shore (badadup)

Two three four
Tell the people what she wore

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini
That she wore for the first time today
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini
So in the blanket, she wanted to stay

Two three four
Stick around we'll tell you more
Bop bop bop bop bopopopopopopop

Now she's afraid to come out of the water
And I wonder what she's gonna do
Now she's afraid to come out of the water
And the poor little girl's turning blue

Two three four
Tell the people what she wore

It was an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini
That she wore for the first time today
An itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini
So in the water, she wanted to stay

From the locker to the blanket
From the blanket to the shore
From the shore to the water
Guess there isn't any more
