Rosemary Clooney: Half As Much
--------------------------------

if you loved me half as much as i love you
you wouldnt worry me half as much as you do
you're nice to me when theres no one else around
you only build me up to let me down
if you missed me half as much as i miss you
you wouldnt stay away half as much as you do
i know that i would never be this blue
if you only loved me half as much as i love you

(musical interlude)
