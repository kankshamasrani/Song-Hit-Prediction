Frankie Laine: High Noon (Do Not Forsake Me)
----------------------------------------------

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
On this, our wedding day
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Wait; wait alone
I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
For I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love an' duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearing high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life for his an'
I'm not afraid of death but, oh, what shall I do
If you leave me? 

Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh, my darlin'
Although you're grievin', don't think of leavin'
Now that I need you by my side

Wait along (wait along)
Wait along
Wait along (wait along, wait along, wait along, wait along)
