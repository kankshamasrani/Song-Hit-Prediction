Christina Aguilera: I Turn To You
-----------------------------------

When I'm lost in the rain
In your eyes I know I'll find the light
To light my way

When I'm scared
Losing ground
When my world is going crazy
You can turn it all around

And when I'm down you're there
Pushing me to the top
You're always there
Giving me all you've got

For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm
I turn to you

For the strength to be strong
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
For everything that's true
I turn to you, yeah

Oh, when I lose the will to win
I just reach to you
And I can reach the sky again

I can do anything
'Cause your love is so amazing
'Cause your love inspires me

And when I need a friend
You're always on my side
Giving me faith
Taking me through the night

(For a shield) For a shield (From the storm) from the storm
(For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm) For a love to keep me safe and warm
(I turn to you) I turn to you

(For the strength) For the strength (To be strong)
For the will to carry on
For everything you do
I turn to you, yeah, ohoho

For the arms to be my shelter
Through all the rain
For truth that will never change
For someone to lean on

For a heart I can rely on through anything
For the one who I can run to!
Ohoho, ah

(For a shield from the storm
For a friend, for a love
To keep me safe and warm) To keep me safe and warm, yeaheah
(I turn to you) I turn to you

(For the strength) For the strength (To be strong)
For the will to carry on, ohoho
(For everything you do) Everything you do
(For everything) That's true

For everything you do, ohoho
For everything that's true
I turn to you
