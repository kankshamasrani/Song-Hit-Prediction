Samantha Mumba: Gotta Tell You
--------------------------------

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Your love for me came as a waterfall 
Flowing inside me like never before 
Your love for me something I didn't see 
But baby, I know better now 
When you walked in the room that very night 
A special feeling just burst inside 
It was only you, nobody else but baby, 
I know better now

Chorus
Don't wanna love you, if you don't love me 
Don't wanna need you when you won't need me too
Don't wanna tell you this now 
But it wouldn't be right if I (if I)
Didn't tell you this tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And now you're back inside my house again 
I'm trying deeply to explain 
'Cause baby I wanna get it on 
And baby, you're the one for me 
And now that I have got you all alone 
After all this talking on the phone 
I should be strong, there's nothing wrong 
I'll tell you this is where you belong

(2x Chorus)

There was something in your eyes made me realize
Now I hear voices deep inside telling me, telling me it's you and I

(2x Chorus)
