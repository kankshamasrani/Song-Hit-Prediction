*NSYNC: Bye Bye Bye
---------------------

Hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye

Bye, bye

I'm doing this tonight
You're probably gonna start a fight
I know this can't be right
Hey, baby, come on

I loved you endlessly
And you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

Just hit me with the truth
Girl, you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby, come on

I lived for you and me
And now I've really come to see
That life would be much better once you're gone

I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye

I'm givin' up, I know for sure
I don't wanna be the reason for your love no more (Bye, bye)
I'm checking out I'm signing off
I don't wannna be the loser and I've had enough

I don't wanna be your fool
In this game for two
So I'm leavin' you behind

Bye, bye, bye
I don't wanna make it tough (Make it tough)
But I've had enough
And it ain't no lie, bye, bye

I don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two
I don't wanna be your fool
But it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye (Bye, bye)

Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I've had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie
Baby, bye, bye, bye
