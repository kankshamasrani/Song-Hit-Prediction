You never try me
Always stood right by me
Make living lively
Highly spoken of
My only love
The only one,you're my wifey
Make my life complete,sweet
But you know when to flip it street
Freak but only when it comes to me
see thats why you're my wifey

Guess I should have known
Cause you had my mind blown ,oh,oh
Full of junk at the club on bump like what
I had to have you babe
Saw you outside, passenger side
Cause I let my bestfriend drive
You was in line
Thats when you caught my eye's girl

You were so beautiful girl
It was so critical girl
You looked so crucial girl
Something about you is everything
You are mine

Chorus

You know you're sexy too
I like your attitude
I ain't even mad at you
Girl you're still my boo
Either braids or weave
Skirt or jeans you're still my queen
Babygirl go do you're thing
I'm so glad your on my team

You are so beautiful girl (so beautiful)
It is so critical girl (so critical)
You looked so crucial girl
Something about you is everything
You are mine

Chorus

Someone I can spend my life with
Leave the keys to the Benz
Wedding band with some Gems
You're someone i feel alright with
Someone to have my kids
Someone I can depend
(something bout my wifey
yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah,yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah)
Chorus

Skinny designer fit real jiggy
Ain't fraid to hump with me
When we get busy
Ride out I licky-lick it
Till I get dizzy
Toes done,fresh scent
I think it's sizzly
Oh someone who was down with me
Used to struggle
Now I both count the g's with me
Pop the champagne
Lets take a sippy-sippy
Describe you I try to
You're my wifey

Will you be my wifey?
(yes I'll be your wifey)
Oh say you'll be my wifey girl
(Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah)
Will you be my wifey?
(Yes I'll be your wifey)
Oh say you'll be my wifey girl
(Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah)
