Samantha Sang: Emotion
------------------------

It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside, oh
And who is the one you're clingin' to
Instead of me tonight?

And where are you now
Now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
But you never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night
Good night

I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are, ah
But you got a part of someone else
You go to find your shining star

And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night

And where are you now
Now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go

I cry me a river
That leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
You know that there'll be
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight
Nobody left in this world to kiss good night
Good night, good night, good night

In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
