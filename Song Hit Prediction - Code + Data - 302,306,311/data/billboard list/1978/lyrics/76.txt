Rick James: You And I
-----------------------

You and I
We fit together like a glove on hand, that's right
And don't you know
That I would gladly take you anywhere you wanted to go
You and me
We are as close as two part harmony, wouldn't you agree
And given the chance
Our romance in the end would surely be the end of me

(Some people must say I'm infatuated with you
I don't care 'cause they really don't know
They'll never see or hear the things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned they all can go to hell
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo)

You and I
Will be together 'til the six is nine, that's right
And when you need me
I never hesitate, I always come - it's so much fun
You and I
Although we're poor our love has greater wealth than Hughes himself
And given the chance
That there's an afterlife when we die, it's with you and I

(Some people must say I'm infatuated with you
I don't care 'cause they really don't know
They'll never see or hear the things I do with you
So far as I'm concerned they all can go to hell
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo - doo, doo, doo)
