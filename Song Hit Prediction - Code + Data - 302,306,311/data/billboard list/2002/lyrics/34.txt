You got nothing to lose
Let me do what I do

Come on girl
You can call me any time you like
Doesn't matter day or night
We can do whatever you 
Wanna do it's up to you
Don't fight the feeling
That you feel
I can tell that it's real 
Oh girl
So won't you help me understand
Why you say I'm just a 
Why you say I'm just a friend
