Usher: U Don't Have To Call
-----------------------------

Yo, after tonight

[Intro] (2x)
Don't leave your girl 'round me
True playa for real
Ask my nigga Pharrell 

[Verse 1]
Situations will arise
In our lives
But you gotta be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys
I sacrificed
Cause I knew you could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

[Chorus] (2x)
You don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Verse 2]
Aw, girl
Your face is saying why
Tears in  eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me
Listenin' to friends
Now it's the endin'
Then again, no story can end without it
Damn I...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leavin' baby

[Chorus] (2x)

[Bridge]
Gonna boogie tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home
Waiting for love
So tonight
I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party

(Oh yeahhh
I'm numb)

[Chorus] (3x)

[Bridge]

Chorus(3x)
