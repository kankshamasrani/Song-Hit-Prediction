Eve: Gangsta Lovin'
---------------------

I just wanna rock you 
All night long (Oh Oh Oh Oh)
I wanna rock you
I just wanna rock you
All night long (Oh Oh Oh Oh)

Yo, I need you to understand me daddy
I ain't your average
Baby girl doing it dawg
I'm well established
I ain't trying to lead you on
Just wanna ask if you 
Might wanna give me your name 
Explain your status
You know I seen you time to time
You seem available
Don't mean shit
I know these bitches wanna settle you
Gotta say you on my short list of few
Them other dudes is okay
But I'm feelin' you
Want you in the best way
What you gonna do about it 
Why don't you just test me
You won't wanna do without it
Yo I'm comin at ya hard bein' a thug
And I aint givin up till 
I get that gangsta love (Gangsta Love)
uh huh

I just wanna rock you
All night long (Oh oh oh oh)
I wanna rock you
I just wanna rock you
All night long (Oh oh oh oh)

I know you seen me this night that night
Always my shit tight
Hair done outfit crazy
Skirt fits just right
Wife beater with a banging tan
Walk in demanding all eyes
Baby here I am
Ain't ashamed of my frame 
And I know you're watching
Putting on a show for you pop
And I ain't stopping
A lot of action in your corner
Yeah you gonna do
Only thing that make it better though 
Is me with you
And I know you feeling that
Regardless of your frontin
And I heard through the streets
That it was me you wanting
Let me find out you shy or something
But I know your not
So stop the games
And approach, is you real or not?

I just wanna rock you
All night long (Oh oh oh oh)
I wanna rock you 
I just wanna rock you
All night long (Oh oh oh oh)

Yo! Uh! Okay! numbers exchanged
Now it's in place
Shouldn't have took you so long in the first place
I'm just playing cutie
Yeah give me a call
No it's cool
You don't gotta see me to my car
See I'm a big girl
But you'll find out
Stop for me while I drop top and ride out
Wheels spinning 
Wanna know what shorty all about
But it's cool I'm proven
in these words that's comin out my mouth

It's that gangsta lovin (gangsta)
That just got me buggin (buggin')
It's that gangsta lovin (gangsta gangsta)
That just got me buggin (oh, ah!)

I just wanna rock you
All night long (Oh oh oh oh)
I wanna rock you
I just wanna rock you
All night long (Oh oh oh oh)

I wanna rock you baby 
I wanna hold you baby
Won't you be my baby
I wanna be your lady

I wanna rock you baby 
I wanna hold you baby
Won't you be my baby
I wanna be your lady

You know I want to rock with you (gangsta, gangsta)
