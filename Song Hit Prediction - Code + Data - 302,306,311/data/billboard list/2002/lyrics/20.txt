Creed: My Sacrifice
---------------------

Hello my friend, we meet again - It's been a while
Where should we begin? - Feels like forever
Within my heart are memories, of perfect love,
That you gave to me - Oh, I remember

When you are with me,
I'm free, I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice

We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh, how quickly life can turn around, in an instant
It feels so good to reunite - Within yourself,
And within your mind - Let's find peace there

'Cause,
When you are with me,
I'm free, I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again

'Cause
When you are with me,
I'm free, I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My sacrifice, My sacrifice
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again
My sacrifice
