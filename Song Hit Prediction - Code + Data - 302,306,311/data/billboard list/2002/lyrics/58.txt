Aaliyah: More Than A Woman
----------------------------

Passion, instant 
Sweat beads fill me 
Cupid's shot me 
My heartbeat's racing 

Tempt me (Tempt me), drive me (Drive me)
Feels so exciting 
Thought of highly 
It's yours entirely 

(I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman 
More than your lover 

(I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you 

(I'll be)
(I'll be more) More than a lover 
(More) More than a woman 
(More) Even more under covers 

(I'll be)
(I'll be more) More than a lover 
(More) More than a woman 
(More) More than enough for you 

Midnight grinding'
My heartrate's climbing' 
You go, I go 

'Cause we share pillows 
Chase me, leave me 

There's still no separating 
Morning massages 
With new bones in your closet 

(I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman 
More than your lover 

(I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you 

(I'll be)
(I'll be more) More than a lover 
(More) More than a woman 
(More) Even more under covers 

(I'll be)
(I'll be more) More than a lover 
(More) More than a woman 
(More) More than enough for you 

I don't think you're ready 
I don't think you're ready for this thing 
For this thing 
I don't think you're ready for this thing 

You're not ready 
I don't think you're ready for this thing 
This thing, this thing 
I don't think you're ready for this thing 

Constant pleasures
No scale can measure 
Secret treasures 
Keeps on getting better 

Do you wanna roll with me? 
We can go to foreign lands 
Your hand in my hand 
Do you wanna ride with me? 
We can be like Bonnie & Clyde 
Be by your side 

(I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman 
More than your lover 

(I'll be)
I'll be more than a lover 
More than a woman 
More than enough for you 

(I'll be)
(I'll be more) More than a lover 
(More) More than a woman 
(More) Even more under covers 

(I'll be)
(I'll be more) More than a lover 
(More) More than a woman 
(More) More than enough for you
