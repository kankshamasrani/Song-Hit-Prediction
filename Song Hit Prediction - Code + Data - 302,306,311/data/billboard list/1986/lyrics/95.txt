Force MDs: Tender Love
------------------------

here i lay all alone
tossin turnin
longing for some of your
tender love
i'm waitin 4 the right
moment to come
so i can thank you for
all the tender love you've given to me

(CHORUS:)
tender love (tender love)
love so tender (aaaaaaah)
holdin me close to you
baby i surrender

candles fade like the dark
now i see how
loving a feeling's for
all the tender lov you've given to me
i want you more and more
can't resist you
more than i feel your touch
tender love
LOVIN ME STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART
holy mirror
please let me be a part
of all the tender love you've given to me

(CHORUS)
