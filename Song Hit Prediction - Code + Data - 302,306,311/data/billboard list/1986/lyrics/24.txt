----------------

Go now
Don't look back, we've drawn the line
Move on
It's no good to go back in time

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings, it takes two
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara 
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Danger
In the game when the stakes are high
Branded
My heart was branded while my senses stood by

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings, it takes two
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

('Cause Sara) Loved me like no one ever loved me before
(And Sara) Hurt me, no one could ever hurt me more
(And Sara) Sara
(And Sara) Nobody loved me anymore

I'll never find another girl like you
We're fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
No time is a good time, oh

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time, no

Ooh, Sara
Why did it, why did it
(Sara, Sara)
Why did it all fall apart?
(Sara, Sara)
