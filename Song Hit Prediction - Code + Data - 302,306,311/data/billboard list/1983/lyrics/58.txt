The Tubes: She's A Beauty
---------------------------

Step right up and don't be shy
Because you will not believe your eyes
She's right here, behind the glass
You know you're gonna like her 'cause she's got class

You can look inside another world
You get to talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about

(But don't fall in love) She's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls) She's a beauty
(Why would I lie?) Why would I lie?

You can say anything you like
But you can't touch the merchandise
She'll give you every penny's worth
But it will cost you a dollar first

You can step outside your little world
(Step outside your world)
You can talk to a pretty girl
She's everything you dream about

(But don't fall in love) She's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?) Why would I lie?
(But don't fall in love) If you do, you'll find out she don't love you
(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?) Now why would I lie? Uh

(Step outside your world)

(But don't fall in love) She's a beauty
(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?) Now why would I lie?
(But don't fall in love) If you do, you'll find out she don't love you
(She's one in a million girls) One in a million girls
(Why would I lie?) Why would I lie?

(But don't fall in love)
(She's one in a million girls)
(Why would I lie?)
