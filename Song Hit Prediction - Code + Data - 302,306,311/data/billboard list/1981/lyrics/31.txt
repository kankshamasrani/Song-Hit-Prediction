The Oak Ridge Boys: Elvira
----------------------------

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for Elvira. 

Eyes that look like heaven, lips like cherry wine
That girl can sure enough make my little light shine
I get a funny feelin' up and down my spine
'Cause I know that my Elvira's mine.
So I'm singin'

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for Elvira
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
High-o Silver, away.

Tonight I'm gonna meet her at the Hungry House Cafe
I'm gonna give her all the love I can, yes I am.
She's gonna jump and holler 
Cause I've saved up my last two dollars
We're gonna search and find that preacher man.
And I'm singin' 

Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for Elvira
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
Giddy Up, Oom Poppa Oom Poppa Mow Mow
High-o Silver, away.
 
Elvira, Elvira, my heart's on fire, for Elvira
