Hall & Oates: Say It Isn't So
-------------------------------

[Say it] 
[Say it isn't so] 
[Say it] 
[Say it isn't so] 

Say it isn't so painful to tell me that you're dissatisfied 
Last time I asked you I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen...you see 'em goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way that bites it even more

[Say it] 
Tell me what you want yeah 
I'll do it baby I promise right now
[Say it] 

Who propped you up when you were stopped low motivation had you on the ground
I know your first reaction you slide away hide away goodbye
But if there's a doubt maybe I can give out a thousand reasons why
You have to say it isn't so... 

[it isn't so]
Say it isn't so, oh oh no 
[it isn't so] 
Say it isn't so 
[it isn't so]
Oh, say it isn't so, oh oh no 
[it isn't so] 

[Say it] 

We like to be the strangers at the party, two rebels in a shell
[Say it] 
You like to move with the best of them you know we, we move so well
Don't need someone to lean on, I know that there's an open door 
But if I'm faced with being replaced I want you even more, so baby say it isn't so... 

[it isn't so] 
Oh, say it isn't so, oh oh no 
[it isn't so] 
Say it isn't so 
[it isn't so] 
Oh, say it isn't so, oh oh oh 
[it isn't so] 

[Say it]
[Say it isn't so] 
[Say it] 
[Say it isn't so]
[Say it] 
[Say it isn't so] 

Why you wanna go do you hafta say you wanna go ooh ooh baby say it isn't... 

[Say it isn't] 
Say say say it isn't 
[say it isn't] so 
[so say it isn't] 

Why you hafta say it isn't 
[say it isn't] 
So
[say it isn't] 
So 
[so say it isn't] 

I know it's so hard for you... 
[say it isn't] 
So hard 
[say it isn't] 
Don't say it baby
[so say it isn't] 

There must be some other way 
Don't have to 
[Say it isn't] 
Some other way 
[so say it isn't] 
Aah 

You don't have to say 
[say it isn't]
Oh don't you say 
[so say it isn't] 

Oh you know I want to make you...
