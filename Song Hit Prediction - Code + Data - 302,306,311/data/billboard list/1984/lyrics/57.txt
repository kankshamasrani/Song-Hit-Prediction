Pat Benatar: Love Is A Battlefield
------------------------------------

(We are young, we are young)
We are young
(Heartache to heartache, we stand)
Heartache to heartache, we stand
(No promises, no promises, no demands)
No promises, no demands
(Love is a battlefield, love is a battlefield)
Love is a battlefield
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're begging me go then making me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know, do I stand in your way?
Or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me, I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love and I'm chained to your side

We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand (Ha, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield
(Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
(Ahh)

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We're losing control, will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this gets old, will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer, I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders, you'll need me to hold

We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand (Ha, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield
(Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
(Ahh)

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

We are young
Heartache to heartache
We stand (Ha, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
No promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield
(Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah-ah)
(Ahh)

We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searching our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield
