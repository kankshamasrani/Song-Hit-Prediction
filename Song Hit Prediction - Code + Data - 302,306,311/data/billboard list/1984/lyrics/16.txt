Duran Duran: The Reflex
-------------------------

The-the-the-the-the reflex
The reflex
The reflex
The reflex-fle-fle-fle-fle-flex

You've gone too far this time
And I'm dancing on the valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line

I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand, oh whoa
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand, oh whoa

Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

Why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is a lonely child
Who's waiting by the park
The reflex is a door to 
Finding treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark

I'm on a ride and I want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and the TV set
Don't want to be around when this gets out

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time don't lose it

Why-y-y-y-y why why why-y-y (yeah)
Why-y-y-y-y why why why-y-y (yeah)
Why-y-y-y-y don't you use it?

The reflex is a lonely child
Who's waiting in the park
The reflex is a door to
Finding treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves me answered with a question mark

So why don't you use it?
Try not to bruise it
Buy time, don't lose it

The reflex is a lonely child
Who's waiting by the park
The reflex is a door to 
Finding treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark

Oh, the reflex what a game
He's hiding all the cards
The reflex is a door to
Finding treasure in the dark

And watching over lucky clover
Isn't that bizarre?
Every little thing the reflex does
Leaves you answered with a question mark
