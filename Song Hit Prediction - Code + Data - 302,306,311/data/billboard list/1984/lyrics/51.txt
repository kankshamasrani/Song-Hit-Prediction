Billy Ocean: Caribbean Queen
------------------------------

She's simply awesome

She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the cream 
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah 
Ah she said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

I was in search of a good time 
Just running my game 
Love was the furthest 
From my mind 

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream 
And our hearts, they beat as one 
No more love on the run 

I lose my cool when she steps in the room 
And I get so excited just from her perfume 
Electric eyes that you can't ignore 
And passion burns you like never before 

I was in search of a good time 
Just running my game, yeah
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind, yeah

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream (don't wanna stop)
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run (I love ya, I need ya)

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream 
And our hearts they beat as one (ooh yeah)
No more love on the run

Caribbean queen 
Now we're sharing the same dream 
And our hearts they beat as one 
No more love on the run

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She's the cream, my Carribean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans
Now that I found love, I won't let her go
She's the cream
Oh love, you, love you, love, you, love you
Oh, she dashed by me in painted jeans
She's the cream, Carribean Queen

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She's the cream, my Carribean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
She's the cream, my Carribean Queen
I said she dashed by me in painted jeans
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
