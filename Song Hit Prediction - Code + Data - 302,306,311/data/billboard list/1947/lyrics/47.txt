Kay Kyser: Ole Buttermilk Sky
-------------------------------

Ole buttermilk sky
I'm keepin' my eye peeled on you
What's the good word tonight?
Are you gonna be mellow tonight?

Ole buttermilk sky
Can't you see my little doggie and me
We're as happy as a Christmas tree
Headin' for the one I love

I'm gonna pop her the question, that question
Do you darlin', do you do?
It'll be easy, so easy
If I can only bank on you

Ole buttermilk sky
I'm tellin' you why, now you know
Keep it in mind tonight
Keep brushin' those clouds from sight

Ole buttermilk sky
Don't you fail me when I'm needin' you most
Hang a moon above her hitching post
Hitch me to the one I love

Gonna pop her the question, the question
Darlin', do you do?
It'll be easy, so easy
If I can only bank on you

Ole buttermilk sky
I'm tellin' you why, now you know
Keep it in mind tonight
Keep brushin' those clouds from sight

Ole buttermilk sky
Don't you fail me when I'm needin' you most
Hang a moon above her hitching post
Hitch me to the one I love

You can if you try
Don't tell me no lie
Will you be mellow and bright tonight?
Ole buttermilk sky
