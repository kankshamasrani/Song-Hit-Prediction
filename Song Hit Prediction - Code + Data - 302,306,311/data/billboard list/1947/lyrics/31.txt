Dinah Shore: Anniversary Song
-------------------------------

Oh, how we danced on the night we were wed
We vowed our true love though a word wasn't said
The world was in bloom, there were stars in the skies
Except for the few that were there in your eyes

Dear, as I held you so close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating were murmuring low
My darling, I love you so

The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on
Could we but relive that sweet moment sublime
We'd find that our love is unaltered by time

Dear, as I held you so close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating were murmuring low
My darling, I love you so
