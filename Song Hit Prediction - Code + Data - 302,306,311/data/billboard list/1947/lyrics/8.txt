Al Jolson: Anniversary Song
-----------------------------

Oh how we danced
On the night we were wed.
We vowed our true love
Though a word wasn't said.

The world was in bloom
There were stars in the skies
Except for the few 
That were there in your eyes.

Dear as I held you close in my arms
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms
Two hearts gently beating murmuring low
Darling I love you so.

The night seemed to fade
In the blossoming dawn
The sun shone anew
But the the dance lingered on.

Could we but recall
That sweet moment sublime
We find that our love
In unaltered by time.

Darling I love you so.

The night seemed to fade
In the blossoming dawn.
The sun shone anew
But the dance lingered on.

But we but recall
That sweet moment sublime
We find that our love
Is unaltered by time.
