Perry Como: When You Were Sweet Sixteen
-----------------------------------------

When first I saw the love light in your eye
I dreamt the world held naught but joy for me
And even though we drifled far apart
I never dream, but what I dream of thee

I love you as I never loved before
Sincefirst I met you on the village green
Come to me or my dream of love is O'er 
I love you as I loved you,
When you were sweet
When you were sweet sixteen
