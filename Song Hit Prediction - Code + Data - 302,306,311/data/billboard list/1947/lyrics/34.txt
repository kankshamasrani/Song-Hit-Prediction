Kay Kyser: The Old Lamplighter
--------------------------------

He made the night a little brighter wherever he would go
The old lamplighter of long, long ago
His snowy hair was so much whiter beneath the candle glow
The old lamplighter of long, long ago

You'd hear the patter of his feet
As he came toddling down the street
His smile would hide a lonely heart you see
If there were sweethearts in the park
He'd pass a lamp and leave it dark
Remembering the days that used to be

For he recalls when dreams were new
He loved someone who loved him too
Who walks with him alone in memory
He made the night a little brighter wherever he would go
The old lamplighter of long, long ago, long ago

He made the night a little brighter wherever he would go
The old lamplighter of long, long ago, long ago

Now if you look up at the sky
You'll understand the reason why
The little stars at night are all aglow
He turns them on when night is here
He turns them off when dawn is near
The little man we loved of long ago
