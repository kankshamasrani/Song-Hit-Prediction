Hoagy Carmichael: Ole Buttermilk Sky
--------------------------------------

Ole buttermilk sky
I'ma keepin' my eye peeled on you
What's the good word tonight?
Are you gonna be mellow tonight?

Ole buttermilk sky
Can't you see my little donkey and me?
We're as happy as a Christmas tree
Headed for the one I love

I'm gonna pop her the question, that question
Do you darling, do you do?
It'll be easy, oh, so easy
If I can only bank on you

Ole buttermilk sky
I'ma tellin' you why, now you know
Keep it in mind tonight
Keep a-brushin' those clouds from sight

Ole buttermilk sky
Don'tcha fail me when I'm needin' you most
Hang a moon above her hitchin' post
Hitch me to the one I love

You can if you try, don't tell me no lie
Will you be mellow and bright tonight
Ole buttermilk sky?

Ole buttermilk sky, don't tell me no lie
You can if you try, ole buttermilk sky
