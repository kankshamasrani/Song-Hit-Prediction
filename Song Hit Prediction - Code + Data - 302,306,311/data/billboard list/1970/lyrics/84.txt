100 Proof (Aged In Soul): Somebody's Been Sleeping
----------------------------------------------------

Fe fi fo fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair

They ate up all my food
And I don't stand for such
Don't tell me it was a woman
'Cause a woman don't eat that much
My brand new silk pajamas
They were balled up in a chair
My mind ain't playing tricks on me
Lord help him if he's still here

Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Oh, somebody's been sitting in my chair

Cigarettes in my ashtray
And I don't even smoke
Somebody's been in my best booze
I can tell 'cause the seal is broke
I left my bedroom slippers
Last night at the foot of my bed
And now they're in my living room
And my bed was left unmade

Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Oh, somebody's been sitting in my chair

Fe fi fo fum
I can feel the presence of someone

Fe fi fo fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been eating up my food
Oh, somebody's been walking in my shoes
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
