------------------------------------------------------

Love oh, me let me be lonely, 
Part time love I can find any day. 
So don't you defy mother nature's way, please 
Make it mine, a love for to stay 

I can live without love, 
If I wanted to in this lonely room. 
But I don't want to so I leave it up to you 
To wash away my gloom. 
( I ), I can live without love, 
If I wanted to in this lonely room. 
But I don't want to so I leave it up to you 
To wash away my gloom. 

Do ooh. Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo doo doo doo.
Either you will or either you won't now. 
(either you won't now)
It's up to you I've had my say. 
(I've had my say)
So truly love, do love me completely. 
Hey come on, come on come my way. 

I can live without love, 
If I wanted to in this lonely room. 
But I don't want to so I leave it up to you 
To wash away my gloom.

Doo, doo, doo doo.
