Carpenters: We've Only Just Begun
-----------------------------------

We've only just begun to live
White lace and promises
A kiss for luck and we're on our way (We've only begun)
Before the rising sun we fly
So many roads to choose
We start out walking and learn to run

Can't get we've just begun
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day, together

And when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow

Can't get we've just begun
Sharing horizons that are new to us
Watching the signs along the way
Talking it over just the two of us
Working together day to day, together

Together, and when the evening comes we smile
So much of life ahead
We'll find a place where there's room to grow
Can't gets we've just begun...
