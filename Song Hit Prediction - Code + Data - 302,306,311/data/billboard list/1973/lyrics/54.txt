Chicago: Feelin' Stronger Every Day
-------------------------------------

I do believe in you
And I know you believe in me
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

But now we've realized
Love's not all that it's supposed to be
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day

I know we really tried
Together we had love inside
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

So now the time has come
For both of us to live on the run
Oho, yeah
Oho, yeah

And knowing that you would have wanted it this way
I do believe I'm feelin' stronger every day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

After what you meant to me
Oooh, baby now
I can make it easily
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know that we both agree
Best thing to happen to you
The best thing that happened to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(We love you
We love you
It's a gas, gas, gas)

Feelin' stronger every day
Feelin' stronger every day

Feelin' stronger every day (You know I'm all right now)
Feelin' stronger every day (You know I'm all right now)
