Barry White: I'm Gonna Love You Just A Little More
----------------------------------------------------

It feels so good, you lying here next to me
Oh, what a groove
You have no idea how it feels
My hands just won't keep still

I love you, baby, oh, I love you
I love you, I love you
I just wanna hold you
Run my fingers through your hair

Oh, outta sight
Uh, right there, you like it like that
Closer, come here closer, close
Oh baby, oh baby

Give it up, ain't no use
I can help myself if I wanted to
I'm hung up, no doubt
I'm so in love with you for me there's no way out

'Cause deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keep calling

Eager and eager, yeah
To feel your lips upon my face
Please her and please her
Any time or any place

I'm gonna love you, love you, love you
Just a little more, baby
I'm gonna need you, need you, need you
Every day, yeah
I'm gonna want you, want you, want you
In every way, yeah

[Incomprehensible] for I'll hold back knowin'
This time it looks like love is here to stay
As long as I shall live
I'll give you all I have and all I have to give

'Cause please her and please her
Any time or any place
Eager and eager
To feel your sweet lips on my face

Deeper and deeper
In love with you I'm falling, yeah
Sweeter and sweeter
Your tender words of love keeps calling

I'm gonna love you, love you, love you
Just a little more, baby
I'm gonna need you, need you, need you
Every day
I'm gonna want you, want you, want you
In every way
