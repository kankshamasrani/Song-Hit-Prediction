Stories: Brother Louie
------------------------

She was black as the night
Louie was whiter than white
Danger, danger when you taste brown sugar
Louie fell in love overnight

Nothing bad, it was good
Louie had the best girl he could
When he took her home to meet his mama and papa
Louie knew just where he stood

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-I
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie you're gonna cry

There he stood in the night
Knowing what's wrong from what's right
He took her home to meet his mama and papa
Man, he had a terrible fight

Louie nearly caused a scene
Wishin' it was a dream
Ain't no difference if you're black or white
Brothers you know what I mean

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-I-I
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie you're gonna cry

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-I
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie you're gonna cry

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-I
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie you're gonna cry

Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-I
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie
