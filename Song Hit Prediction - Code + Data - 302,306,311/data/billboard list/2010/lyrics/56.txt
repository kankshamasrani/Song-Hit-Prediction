Ludacris: My Chick Bad
------------------------

My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my my chick bad, better better than yours
My my chick bad, better better than yours

Ludacris
Listen!
I'm saying my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My chick bad, better than yours
My chick do stuff that I cant even put in words
Her swagga don't stop, her body won't quit
So fool pipe down, you ain't talkin' bout shit
My chick bad, tell me if you've seen her
She always bring the racket like Venus & Serena
All white top, all white belt and all white jeans
Body looking like milk
No time for games, she's full grown
My chick bad, tell your chick to go home

My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my my chick bad, better better than yours
My my chick bad, better better than yours

Now your girl might be sick but my girl sicker
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
I knock a bitch out aaaand fight
Comin' out swingin' like Tiger Woods's wife
Yeah she can get a lil' hasty
Chicks better cover up their chests like pasties
Couple girlfriends and they all a lil' crazy
Comin down the street like a parade, Macy's
(WOOOOOH!)
I fill her up, balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
DOH!
But I ain't talk about Homer
Chick so bad the whole crew wanna bone her

My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my my chick bad, better better than yours
My my chick bad, better better than yours

Nicki Minaj
Now will these bitches wanna try and be my bestie
But I take a left and leave 'em hangin like a testi
Trash talk to 'em, then I put 'em in a hefty
Running down the court
I'm dunkin' on them, Lisa Leslie
It's going down - basement
Friday the 13th, guess whos playing Jason
Tuck yourself in, you better hold on to ya teddy
It's nightmare on Elm Street and guess who's playing Freddy
(SCREAMMMMMMMM)
(My chick bad)
Chef cooking for me
They say my shoe came crazy
The mental asylum looking for me
You a rookie to me
I'm in that wam bam purple lam, damn bitch you been a fan

My chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, my chick hood
My chick do stuff that yo' chick wish she could
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my chick bad, better, better than yours
My my my chick bad, better better than yours
My my chick bad, better better than yours

Ludacris
LUDA!!! DTP!!

And when we're all alone
I might just tip her
She slides down the pole
Like a certified stripper
Like a certified stripper
Like a certified stripper
Like a certified stripper.....
