Ke$ha: Blah Blah Blah
-----------------------

Aaaaah
La, da, da
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Coming out your mouth with
Your blah, blah, blah
Zip your lips like a padlock, (Yeah)
And meet me in the back with the Jack
And the jukebox
I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around, boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

BRIDGE:
Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love (Love)
With this song
So just hush (Hush)
Baby, shut up (Up)
Heard enough

CHORUS:
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Boy, come on, give me rocks stuff
Come put a little love in my glove bag
(Yeah)
Wanna dance with no pants on?
(Holler)
Meet me in the back with the Jack
And the jukebox
So cut to the chase, kid
'Cause I know you don't care 
What my middle name is
I wanna be naked
And you're wasted

BRIDGE:
Music's up
Listen hot stuff
I'm in love (Love)
With this song
So just hush (Hush)
Baby, shut up (Up)
Heard enough

CHORUS:
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

3OH!3:
You be delaying
You're always saying some shit (Sense)
You say I'm playin?
I'm never laying the dick
Sayin' "Blah, blah, blah"
'Cause I don't care who you are
In this bar it only matters who I am 

CHORUS:
Stop ta-ta-talking that
Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this?
Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my
Car-ah-ah
If you keep talking that
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah (Oh!)

Blah, blah, blah
Stop talking
Stop ta-ta-talking that
