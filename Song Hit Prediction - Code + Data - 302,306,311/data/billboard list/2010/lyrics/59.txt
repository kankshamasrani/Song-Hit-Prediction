Ke$ha: Take It Off
--------------------

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they... 

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive,
Looking for something wild

And now we looking like pimps
In my Gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey
In my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the morning
But tonight
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on,
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious.
Tear it down,
'Til the sun comes back around

And now we looking so smash
Knocking over trash cans
E'rybody breaking bottles
It's a filthy hot-mess
I'm down to get payed.
I'm not the designated driver so
I don't give a-
I don't give a-
I don't
Oh!

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh... 
Everybody take it off!
Oh Oh Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh...
Everybody take it off

Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
Ohhh...woah

Right now, take it off 
Right now, take it off
Right now, take it off
(Oh...) Everybody take it off

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall
It's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know
If you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore
And there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on
When they take it off
(When they take it off)
Everybody take it off
