Citizen King: Better Days (And The Bottom Drops Out)
------------------------------------------------------

It goes a little something like--like--like this

In my shoes my toes are busted
My kitchen says my bread is molded
I got a good job at the dollar store
One foot in the hole, one foot gettin' deeper
With a broken mirror and a blown-out speaker
And I ain't got much else to lose
I'm faded, flat busted
I've been jaded, I've been dusted
I know that I've seen better days
One foot in the hole, one foot gettin' deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

'Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)

Now my cup's filled up with five-buck wine
I find myself here all the time
Another rip in the glass, another chip in my tooth
Rained on, I've been stained on
Found another goat I tried to put the blame on
And now I'm steppin' on all the cracks
So I guess there ain't no use

'Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)

Do you like my Gucci bag?
That's beautiful, beautiful

Check it--check--check it out

I'm bent like glass, second-hand like glory
Missed the bus but I'm in no hurry
Molasses fast, no business born
One foot in the hole, one foot gettin' deeper
Crank it to eleven, blow another speaker
And I ain't got, I ain't got much to lose

'Cause I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)
I've seen better days
I've been the star of many plays
I've seen better days
(And the bottom drops out)

I know that I've seen better days
(Huh-huh-huh, the bottom drops out)
I've been the star, of so many plays
(And the bottom drops out)
Walked on the edge with that hobo way
(Huh-huh-huh, the bottom drops out)
'Cause I know, I know that I've seen better
Better days
(And the bottom drops out)

Now I'm real thirsty... ha ha ha
