Bobby Darin: Dream Lover
--------------------------

Every night I hope and pray
A dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms
And know the magic of her charms
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover where are you
With a love oh so true
And a hand that I can hold
To feel you near as I grow old
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Someday I don't know how
I hope she'll hear my plea
Some-way I don't know how
She'll bring her love to me

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until all my lover's dreams come true
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover until then
I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do
Until all my lover's dreams come true
Because I want a girl to call my own
I wanna dream lover
So I don't have to dream alone
Please don't make me dream alone
I beg you don't make me dream alone
No I don't want to dream alone.....
