Johnny Rivers: Memphis
------------------------

Long distance information, give me Memphis, Tennessee 
Help me find a party that tried to get in touch with me 
She could not leave a number, but I know who placed the call 
'Cause my uncle took a message, and he wrote it on the wall 

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie 
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis, Tennessee 
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge 
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge 

Last time I saw Marie, she was wavin' me goodbye 
With "hurry-home" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye 
But we were pulled apart, because her mom did not agree 
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee 

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add 
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had 
Marie is only six years old, information, please 
Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee
