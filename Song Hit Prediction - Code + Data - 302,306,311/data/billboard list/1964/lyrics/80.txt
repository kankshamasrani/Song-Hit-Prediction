The Impressions: I'm So Proud
-------------------------------

Prettier, than all, the world
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
You're only one, fellows girl
Oh, and I'm so proud (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you, 
I'm so proud of being, loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue

Sweeter than the taste, of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud girl (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you,
Complements to you, from all the people we meet,
Yes and I'm so proud now (I'm so proud)
Believe me I love you too
I'm so proud of being, loved by you

I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know, if you ever were untrue
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yeah and I'm so proud (I'm so proud) I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being, loved by you
