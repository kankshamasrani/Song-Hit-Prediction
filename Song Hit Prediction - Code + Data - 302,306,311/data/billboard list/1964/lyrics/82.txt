Roger Miller: Chug-A-Lug
--------------------------

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug 
Make you wanna holler hi-dee-ho
Burns your tummy, don't you know
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug 

Grape wine in a mason jar
Homemade and brought to school 
By a friend of mine and after class
Me and him and this other fool decide that
We'll drink up what's left 
Chug-a-lug so we helped ourself
First time for everything 
Mmm, my ears still ring

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug 
Make you wanna holler hi-dee-ho
Burns your tummy, don't you know
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug 

4 H and an ffa
On a field trip to the farm
Me and a friend sneak off behind
This big old barn where we uncovered a covered up 
Moonshine still and we thought we'd drink our fill
And I swallowed it with a smile
Ooh, I run ten mile

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug 
Make you wanna holler hi-dee-ho
Burns your tummy, don't you know
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug 

Jukebox and sawdust floor
Somethin' like I ain't never seen 
Heck, I'm just going on 15,
But with the help of my fanaglin' uncle 
I get snuck in
For my first taste of sin 
I said let me have a big old sip
Bbbb I done a double back flip

Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug 
Make you wanna holler hi-dee-ho
Burns your tummy, don't you know
Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug
