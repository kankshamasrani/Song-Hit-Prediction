Atlantic Starr: Always
------------------------

Girl, you are to me
All that a woman should be
And I dedicate my life to you always

A love like yours is grand
It must have been sent from up above
And I know you'll stay this way for always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me, hey

Ooh, you're like is sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around you bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
And I will love you so for always

Come with me, my sweet
Let's go make a family
And they will bring us joy for always

Oh boy, I love you so
I can't find enough ways to let you know
But you can be sure I'm yours for always

And we both know
That our love will grow
And forever it will be you and me, hey

Ooh, you're like is sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around you bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
And I will love you so for always

Hey, ooh, you're like is sun
Chasing all of the rain away
When you come around you bring brighter days

You're the perfect one
For me and you forever will be
And I will love you so for always

Ooh, ooh
I will love you so for always
Ooh, ooh
