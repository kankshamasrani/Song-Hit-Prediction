Jody Watley: Looking For A New Love
-------------------------------------

You gave me love, you did me wrong
Didn't know what to do
But baby I'm strong, gonna get over you
A new boy I'm gonna choose (You'll see)

My love was true
Still you threw it all away
Now other guys will have me
They'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel

You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

REFRAIN:
I'm looking for a new love baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah
I'm looking for a new love baby
A new love, yeah yeah yeah

Was she hot, did she turn you out
Curiousity rules my brain
Was she worth my heart, it's torn all apart
Are you going back again? (Tell me)

My love was true
Still you threw it all away
But now you're like the rest
Unworthy of my best
Hasta la vista, baby

You know that I needed you
You know that you meant the world to me
You know that I had to have you
Now I'm gonna find somebody new

REFRAIN (repeat twice)

Other guys will have me
They'll appreciate my love
Tell me, how does it feel
But now you're like the rest
Unworthy of my best
Hasta la vista, baby

I'm looking for a new love baby, a new love
I'm looking for a new love baby, a new love
I'm looking for a new love baby, a new love
