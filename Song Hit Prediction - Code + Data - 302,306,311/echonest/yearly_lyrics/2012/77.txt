Trey Songz: Heart Attack
--------------------------

We share, somethin' so charming, still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbing
Even here inside these walls

Breaking each other's hearts
And we don't care 'cause we're so
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack

It's killing me, swear I never cried so much,
'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time, that I frowned the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down

Even when I hold you close
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around

Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much

'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had

And it hurts, 'cause I wanna leave
And you wanna leave
But the love keeps us together
And if I lose you
I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to

That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way
In too deep can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killing me, swear I never cried so much

'Cause I never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
Never knew love, would hurt this fucking bad
Worst pain that I ever had
