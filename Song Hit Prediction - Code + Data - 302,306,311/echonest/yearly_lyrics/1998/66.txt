Ace Of Base: Cruel Summer
---------------------------

MMMMM...
AHHHH...
MMMMM...
AHHHH...

Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning as I sit around
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry
Strange voices are saying (AHHH what did they say?)
Things I can't understand
It's too close for comfort this heat has got right out of hand
(AHHHHH)

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone you're not the only one it's a cruel

The city is crowded my friends are away and I'm on my own
It's too hot to handle so I've gotta get up and go
As in go home... (It's a cruel (cruel) )

Cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone you're not the only one
It's a cruel (cruel)
Cruel summer (leaving me)
Leaving me here on my own
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone you're not the only one
It's a cruel

MMMMM...

Mm now don't you leave me
Mm now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me come on come on
Mm now don't you leave me
Mm now don't you leave me
Now don't you leave me come on come on

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer
Leaving me here on my own (Leaving me here all alone)
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer (leave me hear in this summer)
You're not the only one (you're not the only one, you're not the only one)

It's a cruel (cruel) cruel summer (no)
Leaving me here on my own (ooh ooh)
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer
Now you're gone you're not the only one
It's a cruel
(Cruel summer.  It's a cruel (cruel) 
Cruel summer
(Cruel summer.  It's a cruel (it's a cruel)
Cruel Summer
(It's a cruel summer)
