TQ: Westside
--------------

This is going out to the whole wide Westside,
know what I'm sayin, yeah,
brake it down for me,
steady mop rock, rock on

I was just a young boy living the hood city (eastside Compton G)
back in the days when Ice Cube and Eazy had every nigga talkin about
boy you can't fuck with me remember Ice T had the power (oh,we)
hear gunshots Llickin by the hour
With Too short bumpin every supersport and
taught us all how to ride for the West coast

To my people's if you wit me where you at
throw your dubs in the air
wave them like you just don't care
From L.A. to the bay whats ya say
all day every day any damn day
take a look around we got the whole world locked down
Going on and on and don't stop won't stop, can't stop either ride or die 
That's why I put it down for the Westside

Didn't seem that long ago (oh,no)
We were stealin 40's out the liquor store(oh,no)
momma started trippin so it's time to go
out to the park wit the locsters (huh)
everybody broke smokin roaches.
D.J. Quick was the shit had every nigga claming
he was from the CPT
ya remember one time tried to clown
we had to burn this bitch on down.

One time for niggas in incarceration
I blaze a dime for you for havin lots of patience
Two times for my sisters at the county building
I got some westside love for all your ghetto children
Three times for my niggas that have passed away
I tip some gin for you and pray for better days
One day everything's going to be fine,
but until that day my only reply is Westside till I die.

Got to give it up to the Westside.

From Crenshaw to Foothill Boulevard all I see is
low low's in my cars, Daytons and Five stars
All the true hoes is hittin switches and
all the finest riches of course the bombest bitches don't get it
twisted.
Ask me what's a real G, show me a nigga scraping back
against the wall until his knuckles bleed. (knuckles bleed)
Screaming death to all my enemies
and those who don't believe
Westcoast living be the shit to me
