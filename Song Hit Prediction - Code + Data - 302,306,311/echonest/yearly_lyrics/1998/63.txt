Girl, it just aint right,
What we said last night,
Cause I know we didnt mean it,
You feel the love is gone,
Cause we dont get along,
But I can prove you wrong,
Girl I swear

Chorus
Cause everytime I close my eyes,
I see you,
And how I wanna live my life 
is with you,
There is no one,
Your all I need,
And all I want,
The only one I'll ever love,
I still love you babe,
Cause without you theres no me,
Im still for you girl,
Even though we disagree,
I'll never leave you baby,
Cause I realize I need you in my life.

T-Low
In this relationship we spend alot of time,
Now it would be wrong if everything was always fine,
Girl I know we've had our shares of ups and downs,
But it doesnt mean that we cant work this out,
Oh baby, girl I care.

Chorus 3x's

R.L
And there aint nothing I want do for you,
You can always count on me,
Because I realize, realize, realize,
I need you in my life,
Girl its all,
Girl its all about you,
I'll be right here,
Because I realize
