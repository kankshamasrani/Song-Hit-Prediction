Let's do it, let's do it, ooh baby
Take your time, let's do it, come on baby
Ooh baby, take your time, let's do it

You know you ought to slow down
You been working too hard and that's a fact
Sit back and relax a while
Take some time to laugh and smile

Lay your heavy load down
So we can stop and kick back
It seems we never take the time to do
All the things we want to, yeah

Now, baby we can do it, take the time
Do it right, we can do it baby, do it tonight
Baby, we can do it, take the time
Do it right, we can do it baby, do it tonight

The love I feel for you, you feel for me
One life is all we have to live
Our love is all we have to give, yeah
There are so many things for us to do and see

Let's take some time to be alone
Lock the door, pull out the phone, yeah

Now baby we can do it, take the time
Do it right, we can do it baby, do it tonight
Baby, we can do it, take the time
Do it right, we can do it baby, do it tonight

Baby we can do it, take the time
Do it right, we can do it baby, do it tonight
Baby, we can do it, take the time
Do it right, we can do it baby, do it tonight

Take your time, take the time
Take the time, take the time

Do it, let's do it, let's do it, do it right
C'mon baby, let's do it if it takes all night
C'mon baby, let's do it, let's do it, do it right
C'mon honey, let's do it if it takes all night

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, do it right
C'mon baby, lets do it if it takes all night.
C'mon honey, let's do it, let's do it tonight
We can do it, we can do it, let's do it, do it right

Do it right, we can do it baby, do it tonight
