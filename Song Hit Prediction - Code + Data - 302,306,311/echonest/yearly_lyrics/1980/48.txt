Rocky Burnette: Tired Of Toein' The Line
------------------------------------------

Baby I'm
Tired of toein' the line
Don't know why you wanna jump me
Baby, baby, baby It's makin' me cry

Baby I
I'm gonna find myself someone new
Someone who will be true
I'm no more toein' the line

I know it's over, but
I see the signs
Don't let me waste your precious time

Baby I'm
Tired of toein' the line
If you want to get rid of me
Baby, baby, baby you're doin' fine

Baby I'm
Tired of toein' the line
I'm gonna put on my walkin' shoes
And leave you far behind

You're rollin' over
And over so divine
But you can't fix this broken heart of mine

Rpt. Chorus 2x

(7X)
Baby I'm tired of toein' the line
