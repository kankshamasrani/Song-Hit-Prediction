Hall & Oates: Wait For Me
---------------------------

Midnight hour
Almost over
Time is running out
For the magic pair
I know you gave
The best that you have
But one more chance couldn't
Be all that hard to bear

Wait for me
Please, wait for me
All right, I guess
That's more than I should ask
But won't you wait for me
Please, wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast

You could go either way
Is it easier to stay
I wonder what you'll do
When your chance rolls around
But you gotta know how much
I want to keep you
When I'm away I'm afraid
It will all fall down

So, wait for me
Please, wait for me
All right, I guess
That's more than I should ask
But won't you wait for me
Please, wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

Lovin' is what it does
And ours is doing nothing
But all the time we spent
It must be good for something
Please forgive
All the disturbance I'm creating
But you gotta lot to learn
If you think that
I'm not waiting for you

So, wait for me
Please, wait for me
All right, I guess
That's more than I should ask
So, wait for me
Please, wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast
Yes it is

La, la, la, lady
You gotta lot to learn
If you think that
I'm not waiting for you

So, wait for me
Please, wait for me
All right, I guess
That's more than I should ask
So, wait for me
Please, wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast
Yes it is

La, la, la, lady
You gotta lot to learn
If you think that
I'm not waiting for you

Wait for me
Please, wait for me
All right, I guess
That's more than I should ask
So wait for me
So won't wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast
