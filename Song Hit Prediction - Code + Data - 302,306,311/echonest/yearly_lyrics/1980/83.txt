Pat Benatar: Heartbreaker
---------------------------

Your love is like a tidal wave
Spinnin' over my head
Drownin' me in your promises
Better left unsaid

You're the right kind of sinner
To release my inner fantasy
The invincible winner
And you know that you were born to be

You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker, don't ya mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker, don't ya mess around, no no no

Your love has set my soul on fire
Burnin' out of control
You taught me the ways of desire
Now it's takin' its toll

You're the right kind of sinner
To release my inner fantasy
The invincible winner
And you know that you are born to be

You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker, don't ya mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker, don't ya mess around, no no no

You're the right kind of sinner
To release my inner fantasy
The invincible winner
And you know that you are born to be

You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker, don't ya mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker, don't ya mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker, don't ya mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream-maker
Love-taker
Heartbreaker
