Robbie Dupree: Steal Away
---------------------------

C'mon and hold me, Just like you told me
Then show me... What I want to know

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away Into the night
I know it ain't right
Tease me, Why don't you please me
Then show me, What you came here for

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away Into the night
I know it ain't right
Tease me, Why don't you please me
Then show me, What you came here for

Into the night, babe
Baby tonight...Make it tonight
Ooohhhh...

I caught you glancing my way
And I know what you're after (...no second chances tonight)

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right, Into the night
I know it ain't right, Why don't we steal away
I know it ain't right, Into the night, babe
Why don't we steal away, Make it tonight
Why don't we steal away
