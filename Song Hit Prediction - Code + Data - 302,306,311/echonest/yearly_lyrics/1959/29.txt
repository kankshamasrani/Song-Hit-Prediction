The Drifters: There Goes My Baby
----------------------------------

(Bo-bo) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(There she goes) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(There she goes) (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Bo-bo) (doo-doot-doo-doo)
(Bo-bo) (doo-doo-doo-doo)

There goes my baby
Movin' on down the line
Wonder where, wonder where
Wonder where she is bound?

I broke her heart
And made her cry
Now I'm alone, so all alone
What can I do, what can I do?

(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(There goes my baby) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(There goes my baby) Whoa-oh-oh-oh
(There she goes) Yeah! (There she goes)

I wanna know if she loved me
Did she really love me?
Was she just playing
Me for a fool?

I wonder why she left me
Why did she leave me
So all alone
So all alone

I was gonna tell her that I loved her
And that I need her
Beside my side
To be my guide

I wanna know where is my (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Where is my baby? (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I want my baby (doo-doot-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I need my baby

Yeah, whoa-oh-oh
(There goes my baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
(There goes my baby)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
