Chad Kroeger: Hero
--------------------

Chad
I am so high, I can hear Heaven
I am so high, I can hear Heaven

Both
Oh, but Heaven, no, Heaven don't hear me

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

Josey
Someone told me love would all save us
But how can that be? Look what love gave us
A world full of killing and blood spilling
That world never came

Both
And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away, ah-hah

Now that the world isn't ending
It's love that I'm sending to you
It isn't the love of a hero
And that's why I fear it won't do

And they say that a hero could save us
I'm not gonna stand here and wait
I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
Watch as they all fly away

Chad
And they're watchin' us (Watching us)
They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away
And they're watchin' us (Watching us)
They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away, yeah (Yeah)
And they're watchin' us  (Watching us)
They're watchin' us (Watching us)
As they all fly away, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa
