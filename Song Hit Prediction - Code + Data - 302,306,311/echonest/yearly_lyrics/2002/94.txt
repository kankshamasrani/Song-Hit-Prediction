Toby Keith: My List
---------------------

Under an old brass paper weight,
Is my list of things to do today:
Go to the bank and the hardware store,
Put a new lock on the cellar door.
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done,
But when the sun is settled, there's still more than a few things left
I haven't got to yet.

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer, 
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that i make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Wouldn't change the course of fate,
Cuttin' the grass just had to wait
Cause i've got more important things
Like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow, what I could get done today

Like go for a walk, say a little prayer, 
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that i make time for that
Wade the shore, cast a line,
Look up an old lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Raise a little hell, laugh till it hurts,
Put an extra five in the plate at church,
Call up my folks just to chat,
It's time that i make time for that
Stay up late, and over sleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things i've always missed
Just start livin'...that's the next thing on my list.

Under an old brass paper weight, 
Is my List of things to do today.
