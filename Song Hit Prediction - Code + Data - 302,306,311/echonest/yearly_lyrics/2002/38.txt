Tweet: Oops (Oh My)
---------------------

Tell you what I did last night 
I came home, say, around a quarter to three 
Still so high 
Hypnotized 
In a trance 
From the start it, so butter and brown and tantalizing 
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt 
So shook I had to catch my breath 

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head 
Oh my 
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet 
Oh my 
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg
Oh my 
Ooh I'm turning red 
Who could this be? 

I tried and I tried to avoid 
But this thing was happening 
Swallow my pride 
Let it ride and party 
But this body felt just like mines 
I got worried 
I looked over to the left 
A reflection of myself 
That's why I couldn't catch my breath 

OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head 
Oh my 
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet 
Oh my 
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg....

(Fabolous)
Desert storm yeah, Fabolous yeah.. Tweet yeah.
Shorty I strictly wanna spank you. The most I gotta do
Is spell my name to get your vicki's to your ankles.
I'm seriously mami, you're fuckin' with the Kid
Aka William H. Bonnie
You know I'm the type that be crushin and merkin'
Having ladies touchin' the hurkin, blushin' and smirkin', 
Early in the morning rushin from workin' 
Screamin "Oh my.. F-A B-O L-O U-S"
Each night I'm freakin, ma' you aint gonna talk me to death, 
Cuz you got free nights and weekends
Ghetto Fabs all over the place...
Oops, there goes my kids all over your face...
Oh my!

(Missy)
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm I was looking so good I couldn't reject myself 
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm I was feeling so good I had to touch myself 
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm I was eyein my thighs butter pecan brown 
(I looked over to the left) 
Umm comin' outta my shirt and then the skirt came down 

OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head 
Oh my 
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet 
Oh my 
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg
Oh my 
Ooh I'm turning red 
Who could this be? 

OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head 
Oh my 
OOPS, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet 
Oh my 
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my leg
Oh my 
Ooh I'm turning red 
Who could this be?

OOPS, there goes my shirt up over my head.
