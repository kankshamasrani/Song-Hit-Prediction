Creed: One Last Breath
------------------------

Please come now, I think I'm fallin'
I'm holdin' on to what I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm tryin' to escape

I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

I'm lookin' down now that it's over
Reflectin' on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace

I cried out, "Heaven save me"
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say
Let me say

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

I'm so far down

Sad eyes, follow me
But I still believe there's, somethin' left for me
So please come, stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's, somethin' left for you and me

For you and me
For you and me

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinkin'

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

Hold me now, I'm six feet from the edge
And I'm thinkin', maybe six feet, ain't so far down

Please come now, I think I'm fallin'
I'm holdin' on to what I think is safe
