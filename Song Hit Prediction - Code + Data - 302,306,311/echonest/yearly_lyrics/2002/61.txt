Daniel Bedingfield: Gotta Get Thru This
-----------------------------------------

If only I could get through this
I get through this
I just, I just said, I just, said...

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make, gotta make it, gotta make it through
Said I'm gotta get through this
I'm gotta get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off you

Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me till tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight

When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart keeps breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this

I gotta get through this
I gotta get through this
I gotta make, gotta make it, make it through
Said I'm gonna get through this
I'm gotta get through this
I gotta take, gotta take my mind off you

Give me just a second and I'll be all right
Surely one more moment couldn't break my heart
Give me till tomorrow then I'll be okay
Just another day and then I'll hold you tight

When your love is pouring like the rain
I close my eyes and it's gone again
When will I get the chance to say I love you
I pretend that you're already mine
Then my heart keeps breaking every time
I look into your eyes

If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
If only I could get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this
(Woah, woah, oh yeahh)

If only I could get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this
(Woah, woah, oh yeahh)
If only I could get through this
God, God, gotta help me get through this
I just, I just said, I just, I just said....
