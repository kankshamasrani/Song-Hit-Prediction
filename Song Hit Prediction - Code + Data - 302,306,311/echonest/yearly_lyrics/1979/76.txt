GQ: Disco Nights (Rock-Freak)
-------------------------------

Let the spirit flow all through your body
Just lend us an ear
Involve yourself
You're free to follow
And we'll take you there

You said you want to reach the sky
So get up
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights

The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights

The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights

The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
Whoa

Just say you will
Just do what you feel
I'm for real

The music's full of joy and laughter
And it's such a thrill
To free your mind from all the pressure
Head on up the hill

You said you want to reach the sky
So get up
The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights

Rock free
Rock free
Rock free
Rock free

Don't say you will
Just do what you feel
I'm for real

The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights

The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights

The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
Disco nights

The feeling's right
And the music's tight
On the disco nights
Disco, disco nights

Just dancing with my babe
Feels good all over
