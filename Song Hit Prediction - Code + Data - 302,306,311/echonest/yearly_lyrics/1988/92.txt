John Mellencamp: Cherry Bomb
------------------------------

Well, I lived on the outskirts of town
In an 8-room farmhouse, baby
When my brothers and friends were around
There was always somethin' doin'

Had me a couple of real nice girlfriends
Stopped by to see me every once in a while
When I think back about those days
All I can do is sit and smile

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young, and we were improvin'

Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'

Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah

The winter days, they last forever
But the weekends went by so quick
Went ridin' around this little country town
We were goin' nuts, girl, out in the sticks

One night, me with my big mouth
A couple guys had to put me in my place
When I see those guys these days
We just laugh and say, "Do you remember when?"

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young, and we were improvin'

Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant somethin', baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'

Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
All right

Say yeah, yeah, yeah 
Say yeah, yeah, yeah

17 has turned 35
I'm surprised that we're still livin'
If we've done any wrong
I hope that we're forgiven

Got a few kids of my own
And some days I still don't know what to do
I hope that they're not laughin' too loud
When they hear me talkin' like this to you

That's when a sport was a sport
And groovin' was groovin'
And dancin' meant everything
We were young, and we were improvin'

Laughin', laughin' with our friends
Holdin' hands meant so much, baby
Outside the club Cherry Bomb
Our hearts were really thumpin'

Say yeah, yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, yeah
