The Rascals: How Can I Be Sure ?
----------------------------------

How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changin'?
How can I be sure
Where I stand with you?

Whenever I
Whenever I am away from you
I wanna die
'cause you know I wanna stay with you

How do I know?
Maybe you're trying to use me
Flying too high can confuse me
Touch me but don't take me down

Whenever I
Whenever I am away from you
My alibi is tellin' people I don't care for you
Maybe I'm just hanging around
With my head up, upside down
It's a pity
I can't seem to find someone
Who's as pretty 'n' lovely as you

How can I be sure
I really, really, really, wanna kno-o-ow
I really, really, really, wanna kno-o-ow

(Oh oh oh ...)

How's the weather?
Whether or not, we're together
Together we'll see it much better
I love you, I love you forever
You know where I can be found

How can I be sure
In a world that's constantly changing?
How can I be sure?
I'll be sure with you.
