Rufus Thomas: Walking The Dog
-------------------------------

Baby's back, dressd in black,
Silver buttons all down her back.
High, low, tipsy toe,
She broke a needle and she can't sew.
Walkin' the dog,
Just a-walkin' her dog.
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how the walk the dog.

Asked the fellow for fifteen cents,
See the fellow he jumped the fence.
Jumped so high he touched the sky,
Never got back till the Fourth of July.
Walkin' the dog,
Just a-walkin' her dog.
If you don't know how to do it,
I'll show you how the walk the dog.
