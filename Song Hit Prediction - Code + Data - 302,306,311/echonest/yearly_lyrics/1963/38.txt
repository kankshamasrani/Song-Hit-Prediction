Tommy Roe: Everybody
----------------------

Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had a broken heart now!
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had the blues
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's blue when they're lonesome!
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had the blues
One time or other everbody listen to me,
You loose somebody you love,
But that's no reason for you to break down and cry!
I said a hey everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had a lonely moment!
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everbody's had the blues
One time or other everbody listen to me,
You loose somebody you love,
But that's no reason for you to break down and cry!
I said a hey everybody!
Everbody!
Everybody's had a lonely moment!
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everbody's had the blues
I said a hey everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's blue when they're lonesome!
Everybody!
Everybody!
Everybody's had the blues
