Lesley Gore: She's A Fool
---------------------------

She dunno that she's a lucky girl,
Got the best thing in the whole wide world.
Got a love that's hard to find,
But the boy I wish was mine.

But, she's a fool,
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.

He dunno it but she cheats on him.
With a boy like that, it's such a sin.
I would never be untrue,
I would never make him blue.

But, she's a fool,
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.

I know there's gonna come a day,
He will tell the girl, 'Be on your way,'
Maybe then he'll turn to me,
Then how happy I will be that,

She's a fool,
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.
She's a fool,
She's a fool.
She has his love but treats him cruel.
She's a fool,
She's a fool
