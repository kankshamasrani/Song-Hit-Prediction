Jan Bradley: Mama Didn't Lie
------------------------------

Mama didn't lie, she didn't lie
Mama didn't lie, she didn't lie
Here comes that boy and his friends
Making eyes at me again
Do they all think that I'm a toy
To be played with by every boy?
Well, they're wrong to think I
Will be caught by the wink of an eye
My mama didn't lie. (Mama didn't lie.) She didn't lie

The greatest pastime in this man's world
Is playin' tricks on every young girl
To have one is how they get their kick
But not me because I know their trick
And they're wrong to think I
Will be caught by the wink of an eye
My mama didn't lie. (Mama didn't lie.) She didn't lie
Mama didn't lie, she didn't lie

I remember what my mama told me
She said, "Girl stay in your class
You got a whole lot of growin' and a'learnin' to do
Girl don't cha go so fast

The greatest pastime in this man's world
Is playin' tricks on every young girl
To have one is how they get their kick
But no me because I know their trick
And they're wrong to think I
Will be caught by the wink of an eye
My mama didn't lie. (Mama didn't lie) She didn't lie
Mama didn't lie, she didn't lie
Mama didn't
