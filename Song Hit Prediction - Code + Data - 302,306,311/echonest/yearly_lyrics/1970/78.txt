Mountain: Mississippi Queen
-----------------------------

Mississippi Queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, she taught me everything
Way down around Vicksburg, around Louisiana way
Lived a Cajun lady, we called her Mississippi Queen
You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes was a-gettin' their kicks
Buddy, beg your pardon, I was getting mine

Mississippi Queen, if you know what I mean
Mississippi Queen, she taught me everything
This lady she asked me if I would be her man
You know that I told her I'd do what I can
To keep her looking pretty
Buy her dresses that shine

While the rest of them dudes was a-makin' their bread
Buddy, beg your pardon, I was losing mine

You know she was a dancer
She moved better on wine

While the rest of them dudes was gettin' their kicks
Brother, beg your pardon, now I'm getting mine
Ohhhh, Mississippi Queen
