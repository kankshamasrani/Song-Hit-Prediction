The Moments: Love On A Two-Way Street
---------------------------------------

I found love on a two-way street (I found love)
And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love)
Love on a two-way street (I found love)
And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love)

True love will never die
So I've been told
But now I must cry
It is finally goodbye, I know

With music softly playing
Her lips were gently saying "I love you" (I love you, I love you)
She held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation
And then she walked out

How could I be so blind
To give up love the very first time?
To be fooled is a hurting thing
To be loathed and fooled is a crying shame
While I bear the blame
As she laughs my name

With music softly playing
Her lips were gently saying "Honey, I love you" (I love you, I love you)
She held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation
And then she walked out

I found love on a two-way street (I found love)
And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love)
Love on a two-way street (I found love)
And lost it on a lonely highway (I lost love, I lost love)
