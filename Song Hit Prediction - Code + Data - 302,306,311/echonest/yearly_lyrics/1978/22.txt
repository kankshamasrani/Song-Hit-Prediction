Nick Gilder: Hot Child In The City
------------------------------------

Danger in the shape of somethin' wild
Stranger dressed in black, she's a hungry child
No one knows who she is or what her name is
I don't know where she came from or what her game is

Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty
Hot child in the city

So young to be loose and on her own
Young boys, they all want to take her home
She goes downtown, the boys all stop and stare
When she goes downtown, she walks like she just don't care, yeah

Hot child in the city
Hot child in the city
Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty, yeah
Hot child in the city

Come on down to my place, baby
We'll talk about love
Come on down to my place, woman
We'll make love

Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
She's kinda dangerous
(Hot child in the city)
Young child
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)
Young child, runnin' wild
(Hot child in the city)

Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
(Hot child in the city)
(Hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
Hot child in the city
(Hot child in the city)
Oh

Hot child
