Billy Squier: Rock Me Tonite
------------------------------

I'm rockin' tonite, I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble, gonna grab my share
I want you tonight, I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree, yeah

(You want it all right) We're goin' in style
Say you walk right--you talk right--and your hair's so wild
(Snow-white) Hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between

Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment, leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion, set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near

Take me in your arms
Roll me through the night
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

(You do it all right) You're passion to see
You been schooled in the arts of romancin' me
(Hold tight) You're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside

No one's stopping us now
We go down, down where the music's loud
(It's all night) Hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love, play it all for me

Life's never easy, we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances, side by side
Live for the moment, on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be

Take me in your arms
Roll me through the night
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

Take me in your arms
It's alright (it's alright)
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

A time for all and all in time
A step beyond the borderline
Of who we are and where we long to be, yeah
Every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away

Come on, babe
Take me in your arms
Roll me through the night
Take me to your heart
Rock me tonite

Take me in your arms
It's alright (it's alright)
Take me to your heart, come and take me
Rock me tonite

Take me in your arms
Turn me to the light
Take me to your heart
Rock me, rock, rock, rock 'n roll me
Rock, rock, rock 'n roll me
It's alright
