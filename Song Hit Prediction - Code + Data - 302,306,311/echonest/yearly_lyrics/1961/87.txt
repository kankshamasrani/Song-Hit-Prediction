(Good time baby -yeah)

My chick's dynamite, kicks, kicks ev'ry night
Good time baby--- let's go crazy
You're such a thrill to kiss
Too much when we twist
Good time baby, I'm gonna stick with you

You're a real cool baby and I don't mean maybe
And when I'm with you everything we do moves me to my soul (hmm)
