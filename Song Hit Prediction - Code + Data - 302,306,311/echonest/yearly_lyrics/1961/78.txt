Brook Benton: Think Twice
---------------------------

You don't know how much you hurt me
When you broke our precious vows
But I can't stop loving you
I know it's too late to turn back now

Though I said, "Go on, be happy, bless you, child"
I thought you could guess somehow
My secret heart was saying
"Man, it's too late to turn back now"

Was I a fool from the start
Building castles in the skies?
Or did I just dream I saw
Heaven shining in your eyes?

If you knew how much I love you, yes, I do
Oh, my darling, your heart would bow
Mmm, yes, you'd know, you'd know why I have said
"It's too late to turn back now"

(Too late to turn back now)
Yes, I love you
(Too late to turn back now)
