The Outsiders: Time Won't Let Me
----------------------------------

I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know and if you'll be true

Time won't let me
(Oh, no)
Time won't let me
(Oh, no)
Time won't let me
Wait that long

Can't you see
I've waited too long
To love you
To hold you in my arms

Time won't let me
(Oh, no)
Time won't let me
(Oh, no)
Time won't let me
Wow

I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know and if you'll be true

Time won't let me
(Oh, no)
Time won't let me
(Oh, no)
Time won't let me
Wait that long

It won't let me wait that long
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)
It won't let me wait that long
(Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait that long)

Wait, wait, wait, wait that long
Wait, wait, wait, wait that long
Wait, wait, wait, wait that long
