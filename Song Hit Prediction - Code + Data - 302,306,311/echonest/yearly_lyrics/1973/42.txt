George Harrison: Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)
--------------------------------------------------------

Give me love
Give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light
Give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope
Help me cope with this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you
With heart and soul

OM, my Lord
Please, take hold of my hand
That I might understand you

Won't you please
Oh, won't you
Give me love
Give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light
Give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope
Help me cope with this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you 
With heart and soul

OM, my Lord

Won't you please
Oh, won't you
Give me love
Give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light
Give me life
Keep me free from birth
Give me hope
Help me cope with this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you 
With heart and soul

Give me love
Give me love
Give me peace on earth
Give me light
Give me life
Keep me, keep me free from birth
Now, give me hope
Help me cope with this heavy load
Trying to touch and reach you 
With heart and soul

OM, my Lord
