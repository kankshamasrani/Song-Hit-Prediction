Ohio Players: Funky Worm
--------------------------

She's here, Mr. Johnson
Okay, thank you very much
Granny, they're expecting you
You're a little late
So come here this way
Right here

What? Say it now
Oh, say it now, say it now, ahem
Me and the Ohio Players
Are gonna tell you about a worm
He's the funkiest worm in the world
Okay, sing it, Clarence

There's a worm in the ground, yes there is
(That's right, that's right)
He's six feet down
(Six feet down)
He only comes around
When he wants to get down
But when he comes out of his hole
He sounds something like this

Oh, that's funky, that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Come on wit' it again, fellas
Come on wit' it
All through all the land, yeah yeah
Sing it
He plays in a band
Plays in a band
Plays guitar without any hands
Pretty good, I might add
Yeah
When he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck
Everybody wants to get up and dance

Ah, get it baby

I'm his manager, heh, yeah
Gonna make a million dollars
I get it all too, he can't spend it
Don't stop now honey, get down

That's it, that's it
Don't, don't,
Don't fight the feeling
Don't fight it

OK, that's enough, get out of here
Here we go
People listen to this
Gettin' really funky
Get out of here

Goin' back in his hole
Just the same way he came out

Do we get paid for this?
Yes, of course
I just wanted to make sure, we do, okay
OK, you're welcome
