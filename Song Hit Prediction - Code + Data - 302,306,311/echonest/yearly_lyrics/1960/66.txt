Paul Anka: It's Time To Cry
-----------------------------

When somebody leaves you, that's the time to cry 
When you know you're lonely, you're not the one and only 
Who will cry? 

When your heart is broken, that's the time to cry 
When you know she's left you, you'll know that she has left you 
So you can cry 

Happiness is what I long for 
Loneliness is why I cry 


For you have made my heart a slave 
And now it's up to you 

When somebody leaves you, that's the time to cry 
When you know she's left you, you'll know that she has left you 
So you can cry
