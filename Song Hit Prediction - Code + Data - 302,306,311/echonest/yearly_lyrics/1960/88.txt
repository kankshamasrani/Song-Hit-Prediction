Annette: O Dio Mio
--------------------

O Dio Mio, I love him so
O Dio Mio, please let him know
How much I need him
How much I want him
How much I long for his love

O Dio Mio, please hear my prayer
O Dio Mio, please make him care
If he would love me
I'd be in Heaven above
Heaven above

Each time I hear
The church bells chime
I dream I'm his
And he is mine

O Dio Mio, I love him so
O Dio Mio, please let him know
How much I need him
How much I long for his love
Make him my love

How much I need him
How much I long for his love
Make him my love
Make him my love
Make him my love
O Dio, Mio
