Johnny Preston: Cradle Of Love
--------------------------------

[Chorus]
Well, rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
So rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, mmm

Well, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jumped over the candlestick
He jumped so high up above
He landed in the cradle of love

[Chorus]

Hi diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle
The cow jumped over the moon
And on the way down she met a turtle dove
Said "Let's go rockin' in the cradle of love"

[Chorus]

Jack and Jill went up the hill
To get a pail of water
Jack fell for Jill, gave her a shove
They fell into the cradle of love

[Chorus]
