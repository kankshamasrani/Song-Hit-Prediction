Sixteen Reasons
Why I love you

One
The way you hold my hand
Two
Your laughing eyes
Three
The way you understand
Four
Your secret sighs

They're all part of 
Sixteen reasons why I love you

Five
The way you comb your hair
Six
Your freckled nose
Seven
The way you say you care
Eight
Your crazy clothes

That's just half of 
Sixteen reasons why I love you

Nine
Snuggling in the car
Ten
Your wish upon a star
Eleven
Whispering on the phone
Twelve
Your kiss when we're alone
Thirteen
The way you thrill my heart
Fourteen
Your voice so neat
Fifteen
You say we'll never part
Sixteen
Our loves complete

Those are all of 
Sixteen reasons why I love you

Sixteen Reasons
Why I love you
