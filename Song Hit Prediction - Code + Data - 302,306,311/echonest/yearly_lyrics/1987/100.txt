Ready For The World: Love You Down
------------------------------------

It never really matter too much to me
That you were just to damn old for me
All that really mattered that you was my girlfriend
And Baby that's all that mattered to me

Let me love you down


Even if it takes all night
Let me love you down
you know its going to be soon right

Remember when I drove you home from work
I love the way
