Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam: Lost In Emotion
---------------------------------------

Hit the beat now

(Lost in emotion)

Some guys will promise you a marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns
Like waiting for that love that I might be getting
Mv dreams haven't yet begun, oh baby

Am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
And my love for you, oh my, I can't conceal

Oh, I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? At least my friends think so

Que sera, que sera
Baby, whatever will be
Que sera, que sera
Between you and me

Just how true are the rumors I am hearing
About the crash you have on me? (ooh)
Oh baby, I'm blind 'cause I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they see

I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend (ooh)
I keep showing emotions not knowing
Just where it all stands for us

From time to time I wonder what I am in your heart
(Sometimes you make me wonder)
And even though I don't live there yet
I'm afraid it will be cold and dark

I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things you really shouldn't know
Oh baby, I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool? At least my friends think so

Que sera, que sera
Baby, whatever will be
Que sera, que sera
(Between you and me) Oh no

Baby, am I a fool 'cause I don't know just how you feel?
(Just how you feel)
And my love for you, oh my, I can't conceal
Hit the beat now

(Lost) With my feeling
(Lost) I hit the ceiling
(Lost) With big emotions
(Lost) I can't be dealing

(Lost) I wanna be with you
(Lost) But I don't know how
(Lost) In my heart, babe
I can feel the beat now

(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)

(Lost) My baby
You know that I'm (lost), my baby
(Lost in emotion) my-m-m-y-my baby
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost)
