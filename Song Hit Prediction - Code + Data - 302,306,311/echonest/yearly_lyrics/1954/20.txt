Doris Day: If I Give My Heart To You
--------------------------------------

If I give my heart to you 
Will you handle it with care 
Will you always treat me tenderly 
And in every way be fair 

If I give my heart to you 
Will you give me all your love 
Will you swear that you'll be true to me 
By the light that shines above 

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad 
Smile with me when I'm glad 
And always be as you are with me tonight 

Think it over and be sure 
Please don't answer till you do 
When you promise all those things to me 
Then I'll give my heart to you 

And will you sigh with me when I'm sad 
Smile with me when I'm glad 
And always be as you are with me tonight 

Think it over and be sure 
Please don't answer till you do 
When you promise all those things to me 
Then I'll give my heart to you
