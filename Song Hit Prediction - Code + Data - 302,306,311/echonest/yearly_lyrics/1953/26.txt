Joni James: Your Cheating Heart
---------------------------------

Your cheating will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come the whole night through
Your cheating heart will tell on you

[Repeat: x2]
When tears come down like falling rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheating heart will tell on you
