Eartha Kitt: C'est Si Bon
---------------------------

C'est si bon
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good

C'est si bon
So I say to you
Like the French people do
Because it's oh, so good

Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C'est si bon

Nothing else can replace
Just your slyest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling...
C'est si bon!
