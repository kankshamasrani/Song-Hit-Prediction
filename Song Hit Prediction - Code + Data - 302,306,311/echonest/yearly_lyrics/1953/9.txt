Perry Como: Don't Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes
--------------------------------------------------

(Pa pa pa pia)
(Pa pa pa pia)

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night
In daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't keep your heart from me
For someday I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love

Too many nights (Too many nights)
Too many stars (Too many stars)
Too many moons could change your mind
(Don't let the moon change your mind)
If I'm gone too long
Don't forget where you belong
When the stars come out remember you are mine

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night
In daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't keep your heart from me
For someday I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love

(Don't let the stars get in your eyes)
(Don't let the moon break your heart)
(Pa pa pa pia)
(Pa pa pa pia)

Too many miles (Too many miles)
Too many days (Too many days)
Too many nights to be alone (Too many nights all alone)
Oh, please keep your heart
While we are apart
Don't you linger in the moonlight when I'm gone (While I'm gone)

Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't let the moon break your heart
(Don't let the moon break your heart)
Love blooms at night
In daylight it dies
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
Don't keep your heart from me
For someday I'll return
And you know you're the only one I'll ever love
(I'll ever love) I'll ever love

You're the only one
(You're the only one)
I'll ever love
