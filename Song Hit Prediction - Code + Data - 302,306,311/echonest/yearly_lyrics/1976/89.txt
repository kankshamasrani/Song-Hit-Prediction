Candi Staton: Young Hearts Run Free
-------------------------------------

What's the sense in sharing this one and only life 
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife 
You count up the years and they will be filled with tears

Love only breaks up to start over again 
You'll get the babies, but you won't have your man 
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh

Say I'm gonna leave 
A hundred times a day 
It's easier said than done 
When you just can't break away (just can't break away) 

Oh, young hearts run free 
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true 
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

It's high time now, just one crack at life 
Who wants to live in trouble and strife 
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm

I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days 
Encourage the babies every time they say 
Self preservation is what's really going on today

Say I'm gonna turn loose 
A thousand times a day 
How can I turn loose 
When I just can't break away (when I just can't break away) 

Oh, young hearts run free 
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
You and me
Ooh, young hearts, to yourself be true 
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you 

Young hearts run free 
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh, young hearts, to yourself be true 
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
It don't love you 

Ooh, young hearts run free 
They'll never be hung up, hung up like my man and me
My man and me
Oh, young hearts, to yourself be true 
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you 

Ooh, young hearts run free
