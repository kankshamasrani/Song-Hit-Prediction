Jefferson Starship: With Your Love
------------------------------------

Don't know what's happened
To me since I met you
Feel like I'm falling in love
Since I met you

I got to know what you doing
Doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, baby
It feels so good, whatever it is

Knew from the start
It had to be you
You got my heart
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with your love

Heaven sent a sign that sent you
I'm going out of my mind
Since I met you

I got to know what you doing
Doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, baby
It feels so good, whatever it is

Whatever it is and
Whatever it's called
I know that it's you
I can't help gettin' involved
With your love

With your love
With your love
With your love

Whatever you did to me
Well, you sure did it good
My heart's filled with loving
And I knew that it would
With your love

Don't know what's happened
To me since I met you
I feel like I'm falling in love
Since I met you

I got to know what you doing
Doing to me with your love
(With your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, doing to me
With your love (with your love)
What you doing, baby
It feels so good, whatever it is

Knew from the start
It had to be you
You got my heart
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with your love

Baby, sweet baby
