Rick Dees: Disco Duck
-----------------------

Quack quack
Quack quack
Quack quack
Quack quack

Went to a party the other night
All the ladies were treatin' me right
Movin' my feet to the disco beat
How in the world could I keep my seat?

All of a sudden I began to change
I was on the dance floor actin' strange (Quack quack, quack quack)
Flappin' my arms, I began to cluck (Quack quack)
Look at me, I'm the Disco Duck

Ah, get down, mama
I've got to have me a woman, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Disco, disco duck
Got to have me a woman
Disco, disco duck
Oh, get down, mama
Try your luck, don't be a cluck
Disco, disco
Disco, disco
Disco, disco
Disco, disco duck
All right
Disco, disco duck
Ah, get down mama

Oh mama, shake your tail feather, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

When the music stopped I returned to my seat
But there's no stoppin' a duck and his beat (Quack quack, quack quack)
So I got back up to try my luck (Quack quack, quack quack)
Why look!

Everybody's doin' the
Disco, disco duck
Disco, disco duck
Wave to me
Try your luck
Don't be a cluck
Disco, disco
Disco, disco
Disco, disco

Disco, disco duck
My, oh my
Disco, disco duck
Get down mama, ha, ha, ha, ha
Try your luck, don't be a cluck
Disco, disco
Disco, disco
Disco, disco

Disco, disco duck
Disco, disco duck
Try your luck, don't be a cluck
Wave to me
I'm so happy
Disco, disco duck
Thank you duck for gettin' down
Disco, disco, disco
Thank you so very much
Disco duck
You're welcome
Disco, disco duck
Try your luck, don't be a cluck
Disco, disco, disco
