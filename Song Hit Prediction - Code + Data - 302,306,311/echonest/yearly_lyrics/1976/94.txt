Barry Manilow: Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again
------------------------------------------------

Doctor, my woman is comin' back home late today
Could you maybe give me something
'Cause the feeling is gone and I must get it back right away
Before she sees 

That I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
All around, tryin' to get the feeling again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver
Every time she walked in

And I've looked high, low, everywhere I possibly can
But there's no, tryin' to get the feeling again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came

Where did it run to, I thought I'd done all that I could
Just to keep the lovelight burnin'
But whatever I've done, I guess I just haven't done it too good
'Cause all that's left is yearnin'

I've been up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again
All around, tryin' to get the feeling again
The one that made me shiver
Made my knees start to quiver 
Every time she walked in

And I've looked high and low and everywhere I possibly can
But there's no tryin' to get the feeling again
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came

And I've been looking, I've been looking, I've been looking
I've been up, I've been down, and tryin' to get the feeling
I've been up, I've been down, I've been tryin' to get
I've been tryin', I've been tryin', I've been tryin' to get the feeling
I've been tryin' to get the feeling again

I want to get that feeling
I want to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling
I got to get that feeling again
And again and again and again
Tryin' to get the feeling
I've been tryin' to get the feeling again
