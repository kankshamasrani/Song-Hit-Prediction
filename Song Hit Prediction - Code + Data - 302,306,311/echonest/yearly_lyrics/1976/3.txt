Johnnie Taylor: Disco Lady
----------------------------

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it 'round, disco lady
Move it in, move it out
Move it in, 'round about, disco lady

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it around, disco lady, well
Hey sexy lady
Said I like the way you do your thang
Lord have mercy girl

You dance so fine and you're right on time
Girl you ought to be on T.V., on Soul Train
When you get the groove there ain't no stoppin'
Just can't help it, but I'm finger poppin'

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it 'round, disco lady, well
Move it in, move it 'round
Move it in, round about, disco lady

Shake it baby, shake it
Baby shake your thang, one time
Shake it baby, shake it
Baby shake your thang

You've got me groovin'
I feel like movin'
You've got me movin'
Can't sit still, I'm groovin' (I like that funky stuff)

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it around, disco lady, well
Move it in, move it out
Shove it in, 'round about, disco lady

Hey, sexy lady
Girl, you drive me crazy
You dance so fine and your right on time
Girl, you driving me out of my mind, yeah

If it wasn't for the girl sittin' next to me
I'd jump right up and outta my seat you see
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
Girl, your movin' me
Girl your groovin' me

Shake it baby, shake it
Baby shake your thang, one time
Shake it baby, shake it
Baby shake your thang

You've got me groovin'
I feel like movin'
You've got me movin'
Can't sit still, I'm groovin' (I like that funky stuff)

Shake it up, shake it down
Move it in, move it 'round, disco lady, well
Move it in, move it out
Shove it in, 'round about, disco lady

Hey, sexy lady
Girl, you drive me crazy
You dance so fine and your right on time
Girl, you driving me out of my mind, yeah

If it wasn't for the girl sittin' next to me
I'd jump right up and outta my seat you see
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
Girl, your movin' me
Girl your groovin' me

Shake it on down
Hey, you got me so set here in this discotech
Girl, you're movin' me
Girl, you're groovin' me

Shake it baby shake it, baby shake your thang
