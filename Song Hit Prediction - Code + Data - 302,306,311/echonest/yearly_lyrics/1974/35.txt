Roberta Flack: Feel Like Makin' Love
--------------------------------------

Strollin' in the park, watching winter turn to spring 
Walkin' in the dark, seein' lovers do their thing, ooh
That's the time I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time I feel like makin' dreams come true
Oh baby

When you talk to me, when you're moanin' sweet & low
When you're touchin' me and my feelings start to show, ooh
That's the time I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time I feel like makin' dreams come true
Oh baby

In a restaurant, holdin' hands by candlelight
When you're touchin' me, wanting you with all my might, ooh
That's the time I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time I feel like makin' dreams come true
Oh baby

Strollin' in the park, watching winter turn to spring 
Walkin' in the dark, seein' lovers do their thing, ooh
That's the time I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time I feel like makin' dreams come true
Oh baby
