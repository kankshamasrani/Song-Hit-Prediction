Paul Anka: (You're) Having My Baby
------------------------------------

You're having my baby
What a lovely way of saying how much you love me
Having my baby
What a lovely way of saying what you're thinking of me

I can see it
Your face is glowing
I can see it in your eyes
I'm happy in knowing

That you're having my baby
You're the woman I love and I love what it's doing to you
You're having my baby
You're a woman in love and I love what's going through you

The need inside you
I see it showing
Oh, the seed inside you, baby
Do you feel it growing?
Are you happy in knowing

That you're having my baby?
I'm a woman in love and I love what it's doing to me
Having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what's going through me

Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put you through it
You could have swept it from your life
But you wouldn't do it
No, you wouldn't do it

And you're having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what it's doing to me
Having my baby
I'm a woman in love and I love what's going through me

Having my baby (having my baby)
What a lovely way of saying how much you love me
Having my baby (having my baby)
I'm a woman in love and I love what's going through me
