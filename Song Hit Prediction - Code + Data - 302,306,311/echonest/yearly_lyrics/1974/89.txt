Charlie Rich: A Very Special Love Song
----------------------------------------

Babe,
Somewhere I know I'm gonna find it, Babe.
It'll have my love behind it,
And it will be...
A symphony...
Of all you mean to me!

A Very special love song...oooh...

And Babe,
If there's a way you know I'm gonna say it, Babe.
If there's a melody, I'll play it!
And I'll play it through,
Especially for you.
And all the words are true!

A very special love song...oooh...

So don't be surprised if you're sittin' alone and you hear it.
'Cause I'm gonna sing it to the whole big lonely world!
So turn your radio way down low and get near it,
And I'll tell the world
I love you girl!

Babe,
If there's an ounce of love, I'm gonna give it to you, Babe.
If there's a breath of life, I'm gonna live it,
Every day for you...
And all my whole life through...
Singing just for you...

A very special love song!...oooh...
