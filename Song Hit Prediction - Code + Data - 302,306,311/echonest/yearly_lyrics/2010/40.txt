Flo Rida: Club Can't Handle Me
--------------------------------

Flo Rida & Nicole Scherzinger:
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)

Flo Rida:
(Haha, Can't nothin' handle me right now.
I see you D. Guetta...let's get 'em!)

Hey
I own the night and I don't need no help
Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stuntin' go wild, can't handle this playa
Life of the club, arrogant like yeah!
Talk like money, so the girls just melt
One too many, all on me like Twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, Models, standin' on chairs
Fall out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out, so much attention
Scream out "I'm in the building" (hey!)
They watchin', I know this
I'm rockin', I'm rolling
I'm holding, I know it
You know it

Flo Rida & Nicole Scherzinger:
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin you watchin me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)

Flo Rida:
Hey
Still feelin' myself, I'm like outta control
Can't stop now, more shots, let's go
Ten more rounds, 'til I get a KO
Paparazzi trying to make me pose
Came to party 'til I can't no more
Celebrate 'cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin' off their clothes
Grand finale, like The Superbowl
Go hard, I run the show
That's right, while I got money to blow
More lights, more ice, when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
Yeah!
I said it
Go tell it
Confetti
Who's ready?
I'm ready!
You ready!?
Let's get it!

Flo Rida & Nicole Scherzinger:
You know I know how
To make em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
(Put yo' hands up!)
(Put yo' hands up!)
(Put yo' hands up!)
The club can't even handle me right now (yeah)
(Put yo' hands up!)
(Put yo' hands up!)
(Put yo' hands up!)

Flo Rida:
You got me watchin now (hey)
Got my attention now (hey)
Got everybody in the club wanting to know now
I am a ladies man
Come be my lady and...
We can both zone out
Bring ya body and let me switch up your atmosphere
Take you out of da club and up in my new Lear
Fly you around the world
What you want baby girl
Are you ready to go now!

Flo Rida & Nicole Scherzinger:
