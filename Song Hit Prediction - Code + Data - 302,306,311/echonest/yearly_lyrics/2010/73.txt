3OH!3: My First Kiss
----------------------

My first kiss went a little like this
And twist, and twist

Well my first kiss went a little like this
And twist, and twist

I said no more teachers
And no more books
I got a kiss under the bleachers
Just hoping that nobody looks

Lips like licorice
Tongue like candy
Excuse me miss 
But can I get you out your panties?

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips
(I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

Well my first kiss went a little like this

I said no more sailors
And no more soldiers
With your name in a heart
Tattoo upon his shoulders

Your kiss is like whiskey
It gets me drunk
And I wake up in the morning 
With the taste of your tongue

In the back of the car
On the way to the bar
I got you on my lips
(I got you on my lips)
At the foot of the stairs
With my fingers in your hair
Baby, this is it

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

My first went a little like this
And twist
And twist

Well my first kiss went a little like this
And twist
And twist

Yeah she won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh
Oooh-oooh-oooh-oooh

She won't ever get enough
Once she gets a little touch
If I had it my way
You know that I'd make her say...
