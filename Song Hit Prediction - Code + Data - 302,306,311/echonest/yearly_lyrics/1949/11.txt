Blue Barron: Cruising Down The River
--------------------------------------

CRUISING DOWN THE RIVER (On a Sunday Afternoon)
Blue Baron/Russ Morgan
- words and music by Eily Beadell and Nell Tollerton, two middle-aged women
who wrote the song to win a British songwriting contest in 1945
- sung by the crew of H.M.S. Amethyst as it made its historic dash down the
Yangtze River in 1949

Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon
With one you love, the sun above waiting for the moon
The old accordian playing a sentimental tune
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon
The birds above all sing of love, a gentle sweet refrain
The winds around all make a sound like softly falling rain
Just two of us together, we'll plan a honeymoon
Cruising down the river on a Sunday afternoon
