Vaughn Monroe: Riders In The Sky
----------------------------------

An old cowpoke went ridin' out one dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
A-ploughin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

(Yippee-i-ay yippee-i-o) 
A ghost herd in the sky

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders comin' hard, and he heard their mournful cry

(Yippee-i-ay yippee-i-o)
Ghost riders in the sky

Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd, but they ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on hear their cry

Yippee-i-o yippee-i-o 
(Ghost riders in the sky)

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin' on our range
Then cowboy, change your ways today, or with us you will ride
A-tryin' to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies

(Yippee-i-ay) yippee-i-ay (yippee-i-o) yippee-i-o 
Ghost riders in the sky

(Yippee-i-ay yippee-i-o)
