Nelly: My Place
-----------------

I use to pride myself on bein' the other man
But now it's flipped and I don't want you with no other man
Why can't you understand that anything I'm offerin'
I gave you the world, but you just wanted arguin'
From the time I picked you up until the time I dropped you off again
Even flipped out on me at the mall again
"It's all his fault again," that's what you're tellin' all ya friends
I ain't pointin' fingers ma, I just wanna call again
See how ya day going, I know they stressing on ya
I know them times get hard, that's why I'm checkin' on ya
It's your truly ma, I got a little message for ya
Anything he can do, girl, I can do it betta for ya, 'cause

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's foreva, it's foreva

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me baby) (ooo girl)
Come on ova to my place (my place) (my place) (ooo naw)
Won't you sit yaself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl
We gon do it our way (ooo naw) (aww yeah)

I heard your friend that told a friend that told a friend of mine
That you was thinkin' that we should do it one more time
If this ain't the truth, then hopefully it's not a lie
'Cause I ain't got no issues with hittin' that another time
We never had a problem gettin' it done
Disagreed upon a lot ma, but the sex wasn't one
And check it, I know you get excited (still) when I come 'round and bite it (girl)
Quit frontin' and quit actin' like you don't like it

I like it, I like it, I really, really like it
I want it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's foreva, it's foreva

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me baby) (ooo girl)
Come on ova to my place (my place) (my place) (ooo naw)
Won't you sit yaself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl
We gon do it our way (ooo naw) (aww yeah)

Shawty where ya been (girl, where ya been)
Feels like a long time, long, long time since I seen ya, yes it has girl
Well, I know I said some fucked up things to you before
But girl, you know I didn't mean it (I'm sorry)
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more fo' sho'
If I thought that you would believe it (would you believe it?)
(Hey girl) 'Cause you make my life so convenient for me

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's foreva, it's foreva

Won't you come on and go with me (come and go with me baby) (ooo girl)
Come on ova to my place (my place) (my place) (ooo naw)
Won't you sit yaself down and take a seat
And let me ease your mind girl
We gon do it our way (ooo naw) (aww yeah)

I like it, I like it, I really, really like it
I want it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it
I like it, I like it, I really, really like it
I want it, adore it, so come let me enjoy it

When we laugh or we cry it's together
Through the rain and the stormiest weather
We gon still be as one it's foreva, it's foreva
