Kenny Chesney: I Go Back
--------------------------

Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause every time I hear that song.

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Livin' life with no sense of time
I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back.

Well, I used to rock all night long
To Keep On Rocking Me, Baby
At frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
'Cause everytime I hear that song.

I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
The taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends
I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall
Growin' up too fast and I do recall
Wishing time would stop right in it's tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back.

We all have a song that's somehow stamped our lives
That takes us to another place and time.

So, I go back to a pew, preacher and a choir
Singin' 'bout God and brimstone and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now, Only The Good Die Young stops me in my tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back.

To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girls, and some raspberry wine
I go back
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back.
I go back...
