Alan Jackson: Remember When
-----------------------------

Remember when, I was young and so were you
And time stood still, and love was all we knew
You were the first, so was I
We made love and then you cried, remember when

Remember when, we vowed the vows, and walked the walk
Gave our hearts, made the start, and it was hard
We lived and learned, life threw curves
There was joy, there was hurt, remember when

Remember when, old ones died and new were born
And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
We came together, fell apart
And broke each others hearts, remember when

Remember when, the sound of little feet
Was the music, we danced to week to week
Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we never give it up, remember when

Remember when, thirty seemed so old
Now lookin' back, it's just a steppin' stone
To where we are, where we've been
Said we do it all again, remember when

Remember when, we said when we turn gray
When the children, grow up and move away
We won't be sad, we'll be glad
For all the life we've had 
And we'll remember when

Remember when
Remember when
