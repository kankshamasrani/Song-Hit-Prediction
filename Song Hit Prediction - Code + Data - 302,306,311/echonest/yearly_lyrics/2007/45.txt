Omarion: Ice Box
------------------

Omarion
Fussin' & fightin' we back at it again
I know that it's my fault you don't understand, no
I got memories, this is crazy
You ain't nothin' like the girl I used to know
Good with Mom, good with Pop, cool with all my niggas (niggas)
I should try, truth is I wanna let you in, but no
Damn these memories & it's crazy
You ain't nothin' like the girl I used to know, ohh

Girl I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse

Omarion
But I got this Icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this Icebox where my heart used to be

Timbaland
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Omarion
But I got this Icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this Icebox where my heart used to be

Timbaland
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Omarion
Why can't I get it right? Just can't let it go?
I opened up, she let me down, I won't feel that no more
I got memories, this is crazy
She ain't nothin' like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you baby but I can't help it
'Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it
And I, I apologize, for makin' you cry
Took me in my eyes & promise you won't do me the same

Girl I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse

Omarion
I got this Icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this Icebox where my heart used to be

Timbaland
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

[Both:]
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Omarion
I got this Icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this Icebox where my heart used to be

Timbaland
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Timbaland
I don't wanna be stuck off in this cold cold world
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl

Omarion
I don't wanna be stuck off in this cold cold world
'Cause I don't wanna be
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl

Girl I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse

Omarion
I said I got this Icebox where my heart used to be
I got this Icebox where my heart used to be

Timbaland
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold

Omarion
Now I got this icebox where my heart used to be
I got this icebox where my heart used to be

Timbaland
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
