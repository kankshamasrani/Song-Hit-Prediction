Kelly Clarkson: Never Again
-----------------------------

I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell by the flames that burned your words?

I never read your letter cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer. Try to make it all okay

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute. Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you, you'll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter, you couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer, repent yourself away

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never!

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks to see my face everywhere
It was you who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
Don't say you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
I never will
I never will
Never again
