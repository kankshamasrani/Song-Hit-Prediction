Glenn Yarbrough: Baby The Rain Must Fall
------------------------------------------

Some men climb the mountains
Some men swim the seas
Some men fly above the sky
They are what they must be

Baby the rain must fall
Baby the wind must blow
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby I must go, baby I must go

I do not love for silver
I do not love for gold
My heart is mine to give away
It never will be sold

Baby the rain must fall
Baby the wind must blow
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby I must go, baby I must go
