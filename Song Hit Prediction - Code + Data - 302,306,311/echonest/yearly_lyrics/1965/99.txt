Del Shannon: Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow The Sun)
----------------------------------------------------

No one will understand what I've gotta do
I've gotta find a place to hide with my baby by my side
She's been hurt so much, they treat her mean and cruel
They try to keep us far apart, there's only one thing left we can do

We gotta keep searchin', searchin', find a place to hide
Searchin', searchin', she'll be by my side
If we gotta keep on the run, we'll follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh

Doesn't matter, doesn't matter what people might say
She's mine, and I'm gonna take her anyway

Gotta keep searchin', searchin', find a place to stay
Searchin', searchin', every night and day
If we gotta keep on the run, we'll follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh

We gotta keep searchin', searchin', find a place to hide
Searchin', searchin', she'll be by my side
If we gotta keep on the run, we'll follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
Follow the sun-ah, whee-ooh
Follow the sun
