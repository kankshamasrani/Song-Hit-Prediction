King Floyd: Groove Me
-----------------------

Aw, sookie sookie now
(Hey! Ugh! C'mon babe!)

Hey there, sugar dumplings
Let me tell you something
Girl I've been trying to say (now)
You look so sweet
And you're so doggone fine
I just can't get you out of my mind
You've become a sweet taste in my mouth (now)
And I want you to be my spouse
So that we can live happily (now now)
In a great big old roomy house
And I know you're gonna groove me, baby (oh yeah, now)
Make me feel good inside
Come on and ...

Groove me, baby
I need you to groove me
(Oh yeah, now now, darling
Ugh! Come on, come on. Hey! Ugh!)

Hey there, sugar dumplings
Come on give me something
Girl I've been needing for days
Yes, some good good loving
With plenty plenty hugging
Ooh, you cute little thing
Girl between you and me (now now)
We don't need no company
No other man, no other girl
Can enter into our world
Not as long as you groove me, baby (oh come on)
Make me feel good inside
Come on and ...

Groove me, baby
Move me, baby
Aw, sock it to me, mamma. (Ugh!)
Aw, I like it like that, baby. (Ugh!)
Groove me, baby (Hey! Ugh!)
Groove me, darling.
Come on, come on
I need you to sock it to me, mama
Come on and ...

Groove me, baby (Hey! Ugh!)
Good God, it make me feel so good inside (now, mama)
Come on, come on and ...

Groove me, baby
Groove me, baby
Aw, sock it to me
Sock it to me, rock it to me
Come on, come on, come on and ...

Groove me, mama
I want ...
