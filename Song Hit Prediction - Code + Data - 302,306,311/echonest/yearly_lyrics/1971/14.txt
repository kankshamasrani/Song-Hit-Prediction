The Undisputed Truth: Smiling Faces Sometimes
-----------------------------------------------

Smiling faces sometimes pretend to be your friend
Smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within (Can you dig it?)
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof

Let me tell ya
The truth is in the eyes, but the eyes don't lie
Amen
Remember a smile is just a frown turned upside-down
My friend, so hear me when I'm sayin'
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof

Beware
Beware of the handshake that hides the snake
Can you dig it, can you dig it?
I'm telling you
Beware
Beware of a pat on the back
It just might hold you back
Jealousy (jealousy)
Misery (misery)
Envy (envy)
I tell you, you can't see behind
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof

Your enemy won't do you no harm
'Cause you know where he's coming from
Don't let the handshake and the smile fool ya
Take my advice, I'm only trying to school ya

Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes, they don't tell the truth
Smiling faces, smiling faces tell lies and I got proof
Smiling faces, smiling faces sometimes...
