Bobby Goldsboro: Watching Scotty Grow
---------------------------------------

There he sits with a pen and a yellow pad
What a handsome lad, that's my boy
B-R-L-F-Q spells mom and dad
Well that ain't too bad, 'cause that's my boy
Well you can have your TV and your nightclubs
And you can have your drive-in - picture show
I'll stay here with my little man near
We'll listen to the radio
Biding my time watching Scotty grow

Making a castle out of building blocks
And a cardboard box, that's my boy
Micky Mouse says it's thirteen o'clock
Well that's quite a shock, but that's my boy
In four short years I've gone from rags to riches
And what I did before that, I don't know
So let it rain on my windowpane
I got my own rainbow
And we're sitting here shining,
watching Scotty grow

Riding on daddy's shoulders off to bed
Old sleepyhead, that's my boy
Gotta have a drink of water and a story read
A teddybear named Fred, that's my boy
What's that you say momma, come on and keep your feet warm?
Well save me a place I'll be there in a minute or so
I think I'll stay right here
And say a little prayer before I go
Me and God are watching Scotty grow
Me and God are watching Scotty grow
