Donny Osmond: Go Away Little Girl
-----------------------------------

Go away little girl
Go away little girl
I'm not supposed to be alone with you

I know that your lips are sweet
but our lips must never meet
I'm dating somebody else and I must be true

Oh, go away little girl (go away little girl)
Go away little girl (go away little girl)
It's hurting me more each minute that we delay

When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So go away little girl
Before I beg you to stay

(Go away little girl) Go away little girl
(Go away little girl) Oh, go away little girl
(It hurts me more the more that we delay)

When you're near me like this
You're much too hard to resist
So, go away little girl
Let's call it a day little girl
Please, go away little girl
Before I beg you to stay

(Go away) Go away little girl
(Go away) Go away little girl
(Go away) Please, go away little girl
(Go away) Go away little girl
(Go away)
