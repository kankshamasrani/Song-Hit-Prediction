Doris Day: It's Magic
-----------------------

You sigh, a song begins,
You speak and I hear violins
It's magic
The stars desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes
It's magic

Without a golden wand
Or mystic charms,
Fantastic things begin
When I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland
It's magic
How else can I explain
Those rainbows when there is no rain
It's magic...

Why do I tell myself
These things that happen are all really true
When in my heart I know
The magic is my love for you
