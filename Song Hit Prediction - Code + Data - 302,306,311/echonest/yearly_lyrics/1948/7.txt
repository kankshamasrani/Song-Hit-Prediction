Dick Haymes: Little White Lies
--------------------------------

The moon was all aglow
And heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

The stars all seemed to know
That you didn't mean all those sighs
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I tried, but there's no forgetting
When evening appears
I sighed, but there's no regretting
In spite of my tears

The devil was in your heart
But heaven was in your eyes
The night that you told me
Those little white lies

I tried, but there's no forgetting
When evening appears
I sighed, but there is no regretting
In spite of my tears

Who wouldn't believe those lips?
Whoever could doubt those eyes?
The night that you told me
Those little white lies
