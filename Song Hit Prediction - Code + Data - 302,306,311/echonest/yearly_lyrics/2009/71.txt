Fabolous: Throw It In The Bag
-------------------------------

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
Now I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Yea I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Nigga I know you don't call yourself hollerin' at my girl
I know you don't call yourself hollerin' at my girl
Keepin' tha baton, Louis Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup just like me.
I'm the one, with them ones. 
Fuck the price on the tag 
Just throw it in the bag. 

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look at price tags
Where they do that at?
Heard that in ATL
When you wen' ATL
Just ask my baby girl
I treat my lady well
Ain't nothin' "soso"
But I know JD well
We in them Benzs, black, white, gray CL
Got niggas askin' did we miss a Mercedes sale?
Shit, I wish it was, but even though it wasn't,
We still doing donuts and I'm half a dozen,
They call me Krispy Kreme, my style is crispy clean
I drive some chicks on these crews, that's some crispy jeans
Ask how much?
Now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn,  what it look like?
I get it 'cause I got it
I got it so you get it
I gave shortie some till she say, oh I get it!
And now that you got it
Put it in the bag
Write your number down
Just put it on the tab.

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Un-huh un-huh un-huh

Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
See I know what I'ma tell her
The same thing that the bankrobber told the teller
Just throw it in the bag 
That's the way it suppose to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic? It's safer to ask it
So get  that nigga I will pay for the casket
That Remy ma got you talkin' plenty huh?
Broke ass nigga couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso 
He ain't got to know so
I'm a gentlemen I send a bottle with that Rose tho'
Oh you gotta man well you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say 'getchu1'
Meet me at the register
I'm there on the regular
They just price checkin'
You can help them in a second
As we proceed to get you what you need
Like we breakin' down the weed
Shortie throw it in the bag 

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
Un-huh un-huh un-huh
Just throw it in the bag
