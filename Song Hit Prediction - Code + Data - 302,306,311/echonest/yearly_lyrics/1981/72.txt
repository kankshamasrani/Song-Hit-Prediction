Steely Dan: Hey Nineteen
--------------------------

Way back when, in '67
I was the dandy of Gamma Chi
Sweet things from Boston, so young and willing
Moved down to Scarsdale, where the hell am I?

Hey, 19
(No, we can't dance together) We can't dance together
(No, we can't talk at all)
Please take me along when you slide on down

Hey, 19, that's 'Retha Franklin
She don't remember the Queen of Soul
It's hard times befallen the soul survivors
She thinks I'm crazy, but I'm just growing old

Hey, 19
(No, we got nothing in common) We can't dance together
(No, we can't talk at all)
Please take me along when you slide on down

Nice
Sure looks good
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Skate a little lower now

(The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing)

Say it again
(The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing)

(The Cuervo Gold
The fine Colombian
Make tonight a wonderful thing)

(No, we can't dance together
No, we can't talk at all)
