Styx: Too Much Time On My Hands
---------------------------------

Yeah, I'm sitting on this barstool, talking like a damn fool
Got the twelve o'clock news blues
And I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps
And a bottle of cold brew
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy?
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all?

Well, I'm so tired of losing, I got nothin' to do
And all day to do it
Well, I go out cruisin', but I've no place to go
And all night to get there
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal?
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail?

Is it any wonder I've got
Too much time on my hands?
Yes, it's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
Yes, it's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands 
Yes, and it's ticking away, ticking away from me
Too much time on my hands (It's tick, tick, tick, tick, tickin' away)
Too much time on my hands (Now I don't know what to do, I say)
Too much time on my hands

Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands

Now, I'm a jet fuel genius, I can solve the world's problems
Without even tryin'
I have dozens of friends and the fun never ends
That is, as long as I'm buyin'
Is it any wonder I'm not the president?
Is it any wonder I'm null and void?

Is it any wonder I've got
Too much time on my hands?
And it's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
And it's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands 
And then it's ticking away, ticking away from me

Too much time on my hands (Tick, tick, tick, tick, tickin' away)
Too much time on my hands (And I don't know what to do with myself)
Too much time on my hands (Mmm)
Too much time on my hands (Tick, tick, tick, tickin' away)
Too much time on my hands (Mm-hmm)
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands
Too much time on my
