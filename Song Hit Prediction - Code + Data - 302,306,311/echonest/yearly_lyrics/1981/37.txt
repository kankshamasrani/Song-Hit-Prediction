Foreigner: Urgent
-------------------

You're not shy, you get around
You wanna fly, don't want your feet on the ground
You stay up, you won't come down
You wanna live, you wanna move to the sound

Got fire in your veins
Burning hot, but you don't feel the pain
Your desire is insane
You can't stop until you do it again

But sometimes I wonder as I look in your eyes
Maybe you're thinking of some other guy
But I know, yes I know, how to treat you right
That's why you call me in the middle of the night

You say it's urgent
So urgent
So urgent, just you wait and see
How urgent my love can be
It's urgent

You play tricks on my mind
You're everywhere, but you're so hard to find
You're not warm or sentimental
You're so extreme, you can be so temperamental

But I'm not looking for a love that lasts
I know what I need and I need it fast
Yeah, there's one thing in common that we both share
That's a need for each other, anytime, anywhere

It gets so urgent
So urgent
You know it's urgent
I wanna tell you it's the same for me
So urgent, just wait and see
How urgent our love can be
It's urgent

You say urgent
Make it fast, make it urgent
Do it quick, do it urgent
Gotta rush, make it urgent

Want it quick, make it urgent, urgent, emergency
Urgent, urgent, emergency
Urgent, (urgent) urgent (urgent), emergency
Urgent, (urgent) urgent (urgent), emergency
So urgent, emergency

Uh ooh (uh ooh)
Uh ooh (uh ooh)
Uh ooh (uh ooh)
