Tony Martin: I Get Ideas
--------------------------

When we are dancing and your dangerously near me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to
I want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to

And when you touch me and there's fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger
I kinda think you get ideas too

Your eyes are always saying, the things you're never saying
I only hope they're saying that you could love me too
For that's the whole idea, it's true
The lovely idea that I'm falling in love with you

When we are dancing and your dangerously near me
I get ideas, I get ideas
I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to
I want to scold you 'cause I care more than I care to

And when you touch me and there's fire in every finger
I get ideas, I get ideas
And after we have kissed goodnight and still you linger
I kinda think you get ideas too

Your eyes are always saying, the things you're never saying
I only hope they're saying that you could love me too
For that's the whole idea, it's true
The lovely idea that I'm falling in love with you
