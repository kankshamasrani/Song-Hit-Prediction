Terry Gilkyson: Marianne
--------------------------

Marianne, Oh, Marianne, Oh won't you marry me?
We can have a bamboo hut and brandy in the tea
Leave your fat old Nanna home
She never will say yes
If mamma don't know now
She can guess, my, my, yes

All night, all day, Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand

When she walks along the shore
People pause to greet
While birds fly around her
Little fish come to her feet
In her heart is love, but I'm the only mortal man
Who's allowed to kiss my Marianne
Don't rush me

All night, all day, Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand

When we marry, we will have
A time you never saw
I will be so happy
I will kiss my mother-in-law
Children by the dozen, in and out the bamboo hut
One for every palm tree, and cok-y-nut, Hurry up now

All night, all day, Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside sifting sand
