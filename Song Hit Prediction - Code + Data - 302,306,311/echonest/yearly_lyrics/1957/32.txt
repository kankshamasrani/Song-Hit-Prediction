Frankie Laine: Moonlight Gambler
----------------------------------

You can gamble for match sticks, you can gamble for gold.
The stakes may be heavy or small.
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost,
You haven't gambled at all.

So they call me a moonlight gambler.
Well, I've gambled for love and lost.
When I gamble for love but it isn't in the cards,
Oh, what heartaches it can cost me.

Win or lose, I'm a moonlight gambler,
And a winner is what I long to be.
So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live,
Till the day Lady Luck smiles down on me.

Well, you can gamble for match sticks,
You can gamble for gold.
Stakes may be heavy or small.
But if you haven't gambled for love and lost,
Well, then you haven't gambled at all.

No, if you haven't gambled for love in the moonlight,
Then you haven't gambled at all.

So I'll gamble for love just as long as I live,
Till the day Lady Luck smiles down on me.

So they call me the moonlight gambler.
Yes, they call me the moonlight gambler.
