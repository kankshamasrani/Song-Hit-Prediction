The Four Lads: Who Needs You
------------------------------

Who needs you to drive me out of my mind
Who needs you, I'd like to know
Who needs you to give me chills when I'm well
How fast can a helpless heart go
I know dear I love you more than a lot
But oh what I got to go through
And so dear I guess the answer is simply
Who needs you, I do

Each time we kiss goodnight
I find that I get so excited
I can't sleep all night
I've lost my appetite
No appetite no sleep at night

Who needs you, I'd like to know
How fast can a helpless heart go
I know dear I love you more than a lot
But oh what I got to go through
And so dear I guess the answer is simply
Who needs you, who needs you...I do
