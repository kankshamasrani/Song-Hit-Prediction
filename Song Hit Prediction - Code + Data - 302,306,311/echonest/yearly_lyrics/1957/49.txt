The Del-Vikings: Whispering Bells
-----------------------------------

Whispering bells
Whisper low
Whispering bells
Love you so
Bring my baby
Oh my baby, back to me
(Baby back to me)

Whispering bells
Loud and clear
Your sweet chimes
Glad to hear
Bring my baby
Oh my baby, back to me
(Baby back to me)

Whispering bells
Whisper low
Whispering bells
Love you so
Bring my baby
Oh my baby, back to me
(Baby back to me)

Baby gone
Baby gone
Baby gone
Baby back to me

Whispering bells
Loud and clear
Your sweet chimes
Glad to hear
Bring my baby
Oh my baby, back to me

Whispering bells
Whispering bells
Whispering bells
Whispering bells
