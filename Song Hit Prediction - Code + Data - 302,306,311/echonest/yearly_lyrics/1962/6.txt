Shelley Fabares: Johnny Angel
-------------------------------

Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
You're an angel to me

Johnny Angel
How I love him
He's got something that I can't resist
But he doesn't even know that I exist

Johnny Angel
How I want him
How I tingle when he passes by
Everytime he says hello my heart begins to fly

I'm in heaven
I get carried away
I dream of him and me 
And how it's gonna be

Other fellas
Call me out for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

On Johnny Angel
'Cause I love him
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see how lovely heaven will be

I'm in heaven
I get carried away
I dream of him and me 
And how it's gonna be

Other fellas
Call me out for a date
But I just sit and wait
I'd rather concentrate

On Johnny Angel
'Cause I love him
And I pray that someday he'll love me
And together we will see how lovely heaven will be

Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
You're an angel to me

Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
You're an angel to me
