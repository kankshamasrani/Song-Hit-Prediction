The name you know of
A little bit change now your boy done blown up
And I'm doing things that gets exposed
Stunting aint a thing to me 
And it's obvious it's plain to see
That you gone make us both 
Get into some things 
That'll scare grown folks
Shi* they might even say
You should leave me alone
Don't be scared
You need to get like me
Stunting is a habit

Just gotta have it 
Shawty can throw anything at me 
I'm gonna bag it
When she sees the carats
They real just like a rabbit
Can't no other boy 
Do the things you like
He aint your type 
Change your life
And if you did your homework
Girl I'm pretty sure you know what I got 
Drop top singing       Jones on       road 
Let me stop 
Stunting is a Habit
