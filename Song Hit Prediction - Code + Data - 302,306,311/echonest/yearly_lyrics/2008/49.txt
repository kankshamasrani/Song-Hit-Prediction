The Pussycat Dolls: When I Grow Up
------------------------------------

Boys call you sexy 
And you don't care what they say 
See every time you turn around they scream your name
Boys call you sexy 
And you don't care what they say 
See every time you turn around they scream your name

Now I've got a confession (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
When I was young I wanted attention (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
And I promised myself that I'd do anything (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
Anything at all for them to notice me (La La La La)

But I ain't complaining (No)
We all wanna be famous (Oh)
So go ahead and say what you wanna say  (Oh)
You know what its like to be nameless (Oh)
Want them to know what your name is (Oh)
'Cause see when I was younger I would say

When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies

When I grow up
Be on T.V.
People know me
Be on magazines

When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it(x2)
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it- Get it?

They used to tell me I was silly (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
Until I popped up on the T.V (La La La La)
I always wanted to be a superstar (Ha Ha Ha Ha)
And knew that singing songs would get me this far (La La La La)

But I ain't complaining
We all wanna be famous
So go ahead and say what you wanna say
You know what its like to be nameless
Want them to know what your name is
'Cause see when I was younger I would say

When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies

When I grow up
Be on T.V.
People know me
Be on magazines

When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
But be careful what you wish for 'cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it

I see them staring at me
Oh, I'm a trend-setter
Yes this is true 'Cause what I do, no one can do it better
You can talk about me, 'Cause I'm a hot topic
I see you watching me watching me, watching me, and I know you want it

When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star,
I wanna be in movies

When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies

When I grow up
Be on T.V.
People know me
Be on magazines

When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

But be careful what you wish for 'Cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
But be careful what you wish for 'Cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it (Get it?)

When I grow up
I wanna be famous
I wanna be a star
I wanna be in movies

When I grow up
I wanna see the world
Drive nice cars
I wanna have groupies

When I grow up
Be on T.V.
People know me
Be on magazines

When I grow up
Fresh and clean
Number one chick when I step out on the scene

Be careful what you wish for 'Cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
Be careful what you wish for 'Cause you just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it
You just might get it- Get it?
