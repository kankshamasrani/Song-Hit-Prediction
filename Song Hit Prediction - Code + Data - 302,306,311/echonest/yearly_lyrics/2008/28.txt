Jesse McCartney: Leavin'
--------------------------

Hey baby girl
I've been watching you all day
Man that thing you got behind you is amazing
You make me want to take you out and let it rain
I know you got a man but this is what you should say

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again?
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more gray skies
Girl we flyin' on a G5, G5

And I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty you tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that, yeah, she gon' be singin'

Now if I talk it girl, you know that I will walk it out
Man I'll put my money, money where my mouth is
Cuz you the baddest little thing that I've ever seen
So imma ask you one time if you got a man

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again?
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more gray skies
Girl we flyin' on a G5, G5

And I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty you tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left left left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
'Cuz we gone and we gone and we gone

No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl you deserve nothing but the best
No stress, no stress, no stress
Girl you need to tell him

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin', never lookin' back again?
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry
No more gray skies
Girl we flyin' on a G5, G5

And I'm leavin', never lookin' back again
So call your shawty you tell him you found a new man
The one who's so, so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
