Lupe Fiasco: Superstar
------------------------

Matthew Santos
If you are what they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
A fresh cool young Lu
Trying to cash his microphone check two one two
Want to believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design? Did you do something new?
Well you're name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me standing outside of Heaven waitin' for God to come and get me
I'm too uncouth, unschool'd to the rules and too gum shoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
Go back what ever you did you undo
Heavy as Heaven, the devil on my two tons too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Lupe Fiasco
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement past the Indian graves where the dinosaurs laid
And out through China nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five this is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say 'cause even with all of that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid meaning we want it to grow meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed and they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise 
They want everything back that they paid 'cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

And the lights are on and they want a show

Lupe Fiasco
So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow 
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autographed picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps 'cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha...
Ha ha ha ha ha...ha

And the microphones and they wanna know
If you are that they say you are - a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on and they want a show
