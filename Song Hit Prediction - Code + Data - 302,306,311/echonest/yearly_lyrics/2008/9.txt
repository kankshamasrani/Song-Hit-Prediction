Hot, little figure, yes, you're a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours
You're a class of your own and

Oooh, little cutie, when you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops, you're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and

You mean to me what I mean to you and

'Cause if I got you I don't need money, I don't need cars
Girl, you're my all and

'Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love

What I feel when I'm with you

With you, with you, with you, with you
Girl

You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie, you know that I will try
To be your everything, yeaheah

And I will never try to deny that you're my whole life
'Cause if you ever let me go I would die so I won't front
I don't need another woman, I just need your all or nothing
