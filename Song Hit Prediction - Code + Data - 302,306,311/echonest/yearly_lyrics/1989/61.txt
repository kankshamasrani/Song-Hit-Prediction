Skid Row: 18 And Life
-----------------------

Ricky was a young boy
He had a heart of stone
Lived nine to five and he worked his fingers to the bone
Just barely out of school
Came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, oh no

He had no money
No, no good at home
Walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone
And now it's

Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go
Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time
And it's eighteen and life to go

Tequila in his heartbeat
His veins burned gasoline
It kept his motor running
But it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure
"Ricky's the wild one"
He married trouble
Had a courtship with a gun

Bang-bang, shoot 'em up
The party never ends
You can't think of dying when the bottle's your best friend
And now it's

Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go
Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen  and life, you know
Your crime is time
And it's eighteen and life to go
Yeah, yeah

"Accidents will happen"
They all heard Ricky say
He fired his six-shot to the wind
And that child blew a child away, yeah, yeah

Hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go, whoa
Eighteen and life, you got it
Eighteen and life, you know
Your crime is time
And it's eighteen and life to go, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa
