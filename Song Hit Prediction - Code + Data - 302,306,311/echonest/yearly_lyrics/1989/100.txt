Keep on moving
don't stop like the hands of time

Click clock

The time will come one day.
Why do people choose to live their live this way?

Keep on moving

Keep on moving
keep on moving
don't stop

Keep on moving.

It's our time
time today
the right time is here to stay

Stay in my life
my life always
yellow is the colour of sunrays.
I hide myself from no one
I know the time will surely come when -
You'll be in my life

my life
my life always

yellow is the colour of sunrays.

Keep on moving
don't stop like the hands of time

Click clock
fing your own way to stay
the time will come one day.

Keep on moving
don't stop

keep on moving
...

I know the time
time today
walking alone in my own way

Extremely cold and rainy day
friends and I have fun along the way

Yes
we do! I hide myself from no one

I know the time will really come when -
You'll be in my life
my life always

yellow is the colour of sunrays.

Keep on moving
don't stop like the hands of time
...
Keep on moving
don't stop
