Sheriff: When I'm With You
----------------------------

I never needed love
Like I need you
And I never lived for nobody
But I live for you

Ooh babe
Lost in love is what I feel
When I'm with you

Maybe it's the way you touch me
With the warmth of the sun
Maybe it's the way you smile
I come all undone

Ooh babe
Lost in love is what I feel
When I'm with you

Baby
Ooh, I get chills when I'm with you, oh oh
Oh baby
My world stands still when I'm with you
When I'm with you

I never cared for nobody
Like I care for you
And I never wanted to share the things
I want to share with you

Ooh babe
Lost in love is what I feel
When I'm with you

Baby
Ooh, I get chills when I'm with you, oh oh
Oh baby
My world stands still when I'm with you, oh woah
Woah, woah, woah

Baby
Ooh, I get chills when I'm with you, oh woah
Oh baby
My world stands still when I'm with you

When I'm with you
When I'm with you
