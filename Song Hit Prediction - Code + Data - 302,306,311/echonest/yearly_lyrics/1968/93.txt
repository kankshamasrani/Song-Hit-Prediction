Aretha Franklin: I Say A Little Prayer
----------------------------------------

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (makeup)
I say a little prayer for you
While combing my hair, now
And wondering what dress to wear, now (wear, now)
I say a little prayer for you

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(you'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(we never will part oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, forever
(that's how it must be to live without you)
Would only mean heartbreak for me, ooh

I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear (us, dear)
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break-time (break-time)
I say a little prayer for you

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(you'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(we never will part Oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, forever
(that's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me)
Nobody but me

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(you'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(we never will part Oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, forever
(that's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me)

My darling, believe me (believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
I'm in love with you
Answer my prayer
Answer my prayer now babe, oh-oh

(Forever) Forever, and ever
(you'll stay in my heart and I will love you)
(Forever) Forever, and ever
(we never will part Oh, how I love you)
(Together) Together, forever
(that's how it must be to live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me)

My darling, believe me
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
This is my prayer
Answer my prayer now, babe
This my prayer
Say you love me too
Answer it right now babe
Answer my prayer
Sy you love me, too
