The Four Seasons: Dawn (Go Away)
----------------------------------

Pretty as a midsummer's morn
They call her Dawn

Dawn, go away, I'm no good for you
Oh, Dawn, stay with him, he'll be good to you
Hang on (Hang on)
Hang on to him
Think (think) what a big man he'll be
Think (think) of the places you'll see
Now think what the future would be with a poor boy like me
Me

Dawn, go away
Please go away
Although I know
I want you to stay
Dawn, go away
Please go away
Baby, don't cry
It's better this way
Ah, ah, ah

Oh, oh, oh, Dawn, go away, back where you belong
Girl, we can't change the places where we were born
Before you say (You say)
That you want me
I want you to think (think) what your family would say
Think (think) what you're throwing away
Now think what the future would be with a poor boy like me
Me

Dawn, go away, I'm no good for you
Dawn, go away, I'm no good for you
Dawn, go away, I'm no good for you
Dawn, go away, I'm no good for you
Dawn
