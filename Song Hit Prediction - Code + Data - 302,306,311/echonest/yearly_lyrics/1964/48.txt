Jan And Dean: The Little Old Lady From Pasadena
-------------------------------------------------

It's the little old lady from Pasadena

The little old lady from Pasadena
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
Has a pretty little flowerbed of white gardenias
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
But parked in a rickety old garage
Is a brand new, shiny red, super-stock Dodge

And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

If you see her on the street, don't try to choose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
You might drive a goer but you'll never lose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
Well, she's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator

And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
The guys come to race her from miles around
But she'll give 'em a length, then she'll shut 'em down

And everybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go)
