Donell Jones: U Know What's Up
--------------------------------

(chorus)
Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl u know what's up

(verse one)
Me and my niggas be rollin'
Schemin' on u and your homies
The very first day of summer
All chromed out in a Hummer baby
Hit the park and parlay
Hopin' that u walk this way
Do u and your girls wanna ride
Play all day and puff on the la

(chorus)

I'm diggin' u and I'm feelin' u
U know what's up
Said I'm diggin' u I'm wantin' u
So tell me what's up

(verse two)
Peep her thighs aand I'm zonin'
Right around two in the mornin'
Looking fly with a sundress on
Think I feel a bone comin' on
Girl u got me wide open
Waitin' all day and I'm hopin'
Baby don't front
Back seat Jeep, u know what I want

(chorus)
