Everclear: Wonderful
----------------------

I close my eyes when I get too sad
I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
And make everything be wonderful again

I hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
I hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that makes me want to cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed and I
Dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say that
Everything will be wonderful some day

Promises mean everything
When you're little and the world is so big
I just don't understand how 
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
When you tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everthing is wonderful now

I go to school and I run and play
I tell the kids that it's all ok
I laugh alot so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't want to go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say that
Everything will be wonderful some day

Promises mean everything 
When you're little and the world is so big (so big)
I just don't understand how 
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes 
When you tell me everything is wonderful now

No, no 
I don't want to hear you tell me 
Everything is wonderful now
No, no 
I don't want to hear you tell me 
Everything is wonderful now
I don't want to hear you say 
That I will understand some day
No, no, no, no
I don't want to hear you say 
That you both have grown in a different way
No, no, no
No I don't want to meet your friend
I don't want to start over again
I just want my life to be the same
Just like it used to be
Somedays, I hate everything
I hate everything
Everyone and everything

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

No
Please I don't want to hear you tell me 
everything is wonderful now

No 
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Everything is wonderful now

I don't wanna hear you tell me
I don't wanna hear you tell me
Everything is wonderful now
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now
Yeah, yeah everything is wonderful now
Oh yeah, everything is wonderful now
