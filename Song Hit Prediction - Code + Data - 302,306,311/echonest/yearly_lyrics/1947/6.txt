Vaughn Monroe: I Wish I Didn't Love You So
--------------------------------------------

I Wish I Didn't Love You So,
My love for you, should have faded long ago.
I Wish I Didn't need your kiss,
Why must your kiss, torture me as long as this?

I might be smiling right now,
With some new tender friend.
Smiling right now with my heart on the mend.
But when I try,
Something in my heart says "No".
You re still there,
I wish I Didn't Love You So.

But when I try,
Something in my heart says "No".
You re still there,
I Wish I Didn't Love You So.

I Wish I Didn't Love You So.
