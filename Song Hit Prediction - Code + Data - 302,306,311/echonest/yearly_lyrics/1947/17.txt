The Andrews Sisters: Near You
-------------------------------

Near You
By Andrews Sisters

There's just one place for me!
Near you!
It's like heaven to be
Near you!

Times when we're apart,
I can't face my heart!
Say you'll never stray,
More than just two lips away!

If my hours could be spent,
Near you,
I'd be more than content
Near you!

Make my life worthwhile,
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days,
Near you!

There is just one place for me!
I'm happy when I'm near you!
It's wonderful as heaven!
A special kind of heaven,
But only when I'm near you!

At Times when we're apart,
I wonder how I can face my heart!
Say you'll never stray,
More than just two lips away!

If my waking hours
Could be spent more Near you!
I would be content!
More than be content just to be Near you!

Make my life worthwhile,
By telling me that I'll
Spend the rest of my days,
All of those happy, happy days 
Soooo Near you!
