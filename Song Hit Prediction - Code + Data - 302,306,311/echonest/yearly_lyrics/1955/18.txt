The Chordettes: Mr. Sandman
-----------------------------

(bung, bung, bung, bung)

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream (bum, bum, bum, bum)
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen (bum, bum, bum, bum)
Give him two lips like roses and clover (bum, bum, bum, bum)
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I'm so alone (bum, bum, bum, bum)
Don't have nobody to call my own (bum, bum, bum, bum)
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

(bung, bung, bung, bung)

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make him the cutest that I've ever seen
Give him the word that I'm not a rover
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over

Sandman, I'm so alone
Don't have nobody to call my own
Please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream

(bung, bung, bung, bung)

Mr. Sandman ("Yesss?") bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a come-hither gleam
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace

Mr. Sandman, someone to hold (someone to hold)
Would be so peachy before we're too old
So please turn on your magic beam
Mr. Sandman, bring us, please, please, please
Mr. Sandman, bring us a dream

("bung, bung, bung, bung")
