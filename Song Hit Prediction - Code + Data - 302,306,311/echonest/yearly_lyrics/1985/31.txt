Ready For The World: Oh Sheila
--------------------------------

Like I always say:
What's good for the goose is always good for the gander
Oh Sheila
Uh

Oh baby, love me right
Let me love you 'til you get aroused
Can't you let the others be?
'Cause with you is where I got to be, yeah

Oh sugar, where you been
Making out with your male friends?
Listen, somebody's gonna hurt you
The way you love to keep hurting me

And we sing
Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you 'til the morning comes
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

Oh baby, understand
That I want to be the only man
But it seems as though it's getting too hard
And I think I'll start to have my own friend

Oh baby, it's plain to see
That you're qualified to fill your needs
You think you've pulled one over on me
Well honey, baby, just wait and see

And we sing
Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you 'til the morning comes
Just tryin' to say, 

Oh baby, it's one, two, three
I love you baby honestly
I want to de-del-de-del-lee
A de-del-de-del-loo

Oh, oh Sheila
Uh, uh, uh, oh Sheila
Oh, oh Sheila
Uh, uh, uh, oh Sheila

Oh baby, love me right
Let me love you 'til you get aroused
Can't you let the others be?
'Cause with you is where I got to be

Oh baby, understand
That I want to be the only man
You think you've pulled one over on me
Well honey baby, just you wait and see

And we sing
Oh!

Oh, oh Sheila
Let me love you 'til the morning comes
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

Oh, oh Sheila
let me love you 'til the morning comes
Oh, oh Sheila
You know I want to be the only one

Here we go,
Oh!
