Stephen Bishop: On And On
---------------------------

Down in Jamaica they got lots of pretty women
Steal your money, then they break your heart
Lonesome Sue, she's in love with old Sam
Take him from the fire into the frying pan

On and on, she just keeps on trying
And she smiles when she feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on

Poor old Jimmy sits alone in the moonlight
Saw his woman kiss another man
So he takes a ladder, steals the stars from the sky
Puts on Sinatra and starts to cry

On and on, he just keeps on trying
And he smiles when he feels like crying
On and on, on and on, on and on

When the first time is the last time
It can make you feel so bad
But if you know it, show it
Hold on tight, don't let her say good night

Got the sun on my shoulders and my toes in the sand
A woman's left me for some other man
Aw, but I don't care, I'll just dream and stay tan
Toss up my heart to see where it lands

On and on, I just keep on trying
And I smile when I feel like dying
On and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on
On and on, on and on, on and on
Ooh
