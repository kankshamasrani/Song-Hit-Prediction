Ja Rule: Livin' It Up
-----------------------

[Ja Rule]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
where all my...
Uh, Yeah
C'mon, c'mon, uh
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, uh
To all my niggaz that be livin' it up, we say...
To all my bitches that be givin' it up, ah
C'mon

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Baby, this aint your typical, everyday, one night thing
It's a physical, ima fuck, you tonight thing
Fuck, knowing your name, get your ass in the Range
And rollover, gettin' blown while blowing the doja
Bring head to a closure
That's a good bitch
Before it's all over, ima leave this bitch
Probably treat this bitch, smoke better
'Cause if you ain't know, gangsters an hoe's go together
Poppin' my collar, partna
Who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot
In the mug and the watch, love me
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me
'cause they ain't fucked me
And they say I'm lucky
Do you think I've got time to fuck all these hoes?
And do all these shows?
Or flight in the llama, Dodge and White Rolls
Uh-oh, another episode

[Hook: (Case) & Ja Rule]
(What, do I do?)
To all ma niggaz that be livin' it up, we say...
(What, I do)
To all ma bitches that be givin' it up, uhh
(What, you do)
To all ma niggaz that be livin' it up, we say...
(What, do I do?)
To all ma bitches that be givin' it up, uhh
(My love for you)
C'mon

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Bitches, just wanna hold the name thats active
That's why they suck dick with mo' passion than average
And I ain't mad at'cha
Never leave you alone
Cause we fucks when I'm home, phone sex when I'm gone
We both grown, both got minds of our own
Plus I freaks off like O-Dog in "Love Jones"
Been in, many zones, baby one hoes, two hoes
From, prissy bitches to hoes that do porno
But you know, the Rule be livin it up
And got all these hoes, givin it up
I like a, little ooh baby, how cute are you?
With a body that rides on sexual
I got a stick, I'll ride right next to you
Do a doughnut, and cut, then I'll open it up
On the freeway, diggin them out, foot on the clutch
Rule baby, not givin' it up

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
C'mon, we get high
C'mon, we get ride
C'mon, we get live
Live yo' life
(Ooooooooh baby)

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Love you so sexy, I just want you next to me
Your whole vibe, like you high on Extasy
'Cause ain't nuthin' but an "E" thang baby
I know that pussy wet like crazy
I wanna feel your passion, come when you ask me
Laugh when you cry, cry when you laughin'
But ain't nothin' happenin'
The bitch got a little too high
Picked up my ride and started crackin'
The radio blastin' "Between Me And You"
But you ain't on the low with that freak thing you do
I thought you knew (What I do)
Know I know (What you do)
'Cause it's been a good night, your head ain't right
Like Teddy P, let's "Turn Off The Light"
And grind it out, takin' no times out
'Til the sun come out
Bitch, when you find out

[Hook 2x]

[Ja Rule]
C'mon, we get high
C'mon, we get ride
C'mon, we get live
C'mon, it's my time
(Oooooooh baby)
