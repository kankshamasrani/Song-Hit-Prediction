Shaggy: It Wasn't Me
----------------------

Rikrok: Yo, man.
Shaggy: Yo.
Rikrok: Open up, man.
Shaggy: What do you want, man?
Rikrok: My girl just caught me.
Shaggy: You let her catch you?
Rikrok: I don't know how I let this happen.
Shaggy: With who?
Rikrok: The girl next door, you know?
Shaggy: Man...
Rikrok: I don't know what to do.
Shaggy: Say it wasn't you.
Rikrok: Alright...

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you up in a your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you're caught up inna

To be a true player, you have fe know how fe play
If she says a night, convince her, say a day
Never admit to a word that she say
And if she claim a you tell her, "Baby, no way."

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me when
I told her it wasn't me?

Make sure she knows she nuh have no right to vex
A never you she see a do da giggolo flex
A smaddy else whey fava yuh inna di complex
Seeing is believing, so you better change your specs

You know she gonna bring a lot of things up from the past
All the little evidence you better know fi mask
Quick pon ur answer, know how fi mask
But if she back a gun, you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
Heard the screaming getting louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reason, it makes no sense at all
We should tell her that I'm sorry for the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player, but you're completely lost

'Cause I say
Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time, she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me
