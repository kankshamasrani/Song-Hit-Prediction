Kenny Chesney: Don't Happen Twice
-----------------------------------

I haven't seen you in forever,
aw you haven't changed a bit.
you didn't think that I remembered,
how could I forget?

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
made a wish on every star
in that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
for the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.

To this day I still taste that first kiss.
How I prayed it wouldn't end,
and in a way seeing you like this
I guess it never really did.

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
made a wish on every star
in that clear September sky.
One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
for the first time in my life.
Oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice.

One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
Three A.M. I fell in love
for the first time in my life
oh that's somethin'
baby that's somethin'
oh that's somethin' that just don't happen twice
oh yeah

We sang Bobby McGee on the hood of my car,
made a wish on every star

One bottle of wine and two dixie cups,
yeah we fell in love
