The Isley Brothers: Contagious
--------------------------------

It's 2 A.M. I'm just gettin in about to check my message,
no one has called but my homies and some bill collectors.
Say your love when somebody wants to borrow money
I two-way her she don't hit me back something is funny.
So I called her mother's house and asked has she seen my baby.
Roll my six around lookin for that missing lady.
Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news
then I put my hand on my head cause I'm so confused.
And then I turned the TV down
Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound,
There's something going on upstairs
And I know nobody else lives here
"bump bump bump" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screamin out...

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
(Then a man said)
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(I just can't believe it)

I ran downstairs looked in the closet lookin for that ooo,
Said a prayer cause only God knows what I'm gonna do
What I saw was enough to drive a Preacher wild
I'm in the hall contemplatin "not in my own damn house".
Who would have thought she was creepin wit another man?
Down Low (Nobody Has To Know) happenin to me all over again
And then I turned the TV down, TV down
Cause I know I heard a squeaky sound,
There's something going on upstairs
Cause I know ain't no one else lives here
"bump bump bump" as I get closer to the stairways all I hear,
And then I hear my baby's voice in my ear screamin...

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
(Then a man said)
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(I just can't believe it)

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild

What the hell is goin on between the sheets in my home?
Baby wait let me explain before you start to point your cain.
Girl I'm bout to have a fit!
Oh it's about to be some shit!
How did I get in to this? Should have never came home with this bitch!
Low down dirty woman, back to where you come from
But baby wait-- - "But wait" my ass
Hit the streets your ass is grass!
Now Mista Biggs before you jump--
Wait how you know my name son?!
Honey wait I was gonna tell ya...
Move this cat looks real familiar
Hmmm?!?! Now don't I know you from somewhere a long time ago?
No no I don't think so.
Yea yea, I feel I know you brother very well.
No No, you mistaken me for somebody else.
Frank-- - SHUT UP! Can't you see two men are talkin?
But-- - Thought I told yo ass to get to walkin!
Now I think ya'll better leave this place,
cause I'm about to catch a case.

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
(Then a man said)
Sexy lady drive me crazy, drive me wild
(I just can't believe it)

Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild
Your contagious, touch me baby give me what you got
Sexy lady, drive me crazy, drive me wild
