Jesse Powell: You
-------------------

You........

I've finally found the nerve to say
I'm gonna make a change in my life
starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
and there's only one reason that I would
and baby it's you....

(CHORUS)
the way you walk
the way you talk
the way you say my name and smile
the way you move me
the way you soothe me
the way you sleep softly through the night
every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours from this day forth

next year lets call this day our anniversary
the day I placed my heart in your hand
and said that it was yours to keep
from this moment on say that you'll always be mine
cuz girl when i'm alone with you
there's only one thing that's on my mind
and baby it's you...

(CHORUS)
the way you walk
the way you talk
the way you say my name and smile
the way you move me
the way you soothe me
the way you sleep softly through the night
every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours from this day forth
(SAXOPHONE SOLO)

I just wanna be yours from this day forth....

(CHORUS)
the way you walk
the way you talk
the way you say my name and smile
the way you move me
the way you soothe me
the way you sleep softly through the night
every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours from this day forth
