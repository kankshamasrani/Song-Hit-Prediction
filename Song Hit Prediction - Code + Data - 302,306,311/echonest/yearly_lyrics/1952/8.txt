Patti Page: I Went To Your Wedding
------------------------------------

I went to your wedding
Although I was dreading
The thought of losing you

The organ was playing
My poor heart kept saying
"Your dreams, your dreams are through"

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you

You came down the aisle
Wearing a smile
A vision of loveliness

I uttered a sigh
Then whispered goodbye
Goodbye to my happiness

Oh, your mother was crying
Your father was crying
And I was crying too

The teardrops were falling
Because we were losing you
