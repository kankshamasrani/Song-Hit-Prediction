Don Cornell: I'm Yours
------------------------

I'm yours,
Heart and soul I am yours.
Can't you see it my eyes?
Can't you hear it in my sighs?
I'm yours.

I'm yours,
Every kiss says I'm yours.
Take my lips and take my arms;
I'm a victim of your charms,
I'm yours.

My life and my love, dear,
Are yours to command.
I stand here before you,
My heart in my hand.

I'm yours,
All the world knows I'm yours.
And I only hope and pray
That someday I'll hear you say,
"I'm yours!"

My life and my love, dear,
Are yours to command.
I stand here before you,
My heart in my hand.

My life and my love, dear,
Are yours to command.
I stand here before you,
My heart in my hand.

My life and my love, dear,
Are yours to command.
I stand here before you,
My heart in my hand.

I'm yours,
All the world knows I'm yours.
And I only hope and pray
That someday I'll hear you say,
"I'm yours!"
