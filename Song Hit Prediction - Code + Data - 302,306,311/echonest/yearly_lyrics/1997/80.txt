Lil' Kim: No Time
-------------------

I got no time for fake niggas
Just sip some cristal with with these real niggas
From east to west coast spread love nigga
And while you keep talkin shit we countin bank figures

Hey I mama Miss Evana
Usually rock tha Prada sometimes Gabana
Stick you for your cream and your riches
Zsa Zsa Gabor, Demi Moore, Prince Diane and all them rich bitches
Puff Daddy pump the hummer for the summer
I follow in the E class with the goggles
96 model
Bad clique on the stroll
(Tell 'em how we roll)
Cruise control
Nuttin make a woman feel better than barrettas and amarrettas
Butta leathaz and mad cheddas
Chillin in the Benz wit my amigos
Tryin to stick a nigga for his pesos
If you say so
Then I'm the same chick that you wanna get wit
And lick up in my twat
Gotta hit the spot if not don't test the pun-pun nadie-nadie pun-nadi-dadi
Hey

I got no time for fake niggas
Just sip some cristal with with these real niggas
From east to west coast spread love nigga
And while you keep talkin shit we countin bank figures ( Repeat 3x)

(How you like it baby uh from the front, uh from the back, give that ass a
smack, uh, bet your man won't do it like that, can't work the middle plus his
dick too little, let me grab your tatas, do the chacha, make you scream papa)

You the best dada
Now watch mama go up and down dip the jaws crazy--UH
Say my name baby, Before you nut
I'ma dribble down your butt cheek, make you wiggle and giggle just a little
I'm drinkin babies
Then I cracks for the Mercedes
Act shady and feel my 380
Gator boots for ladies
Ohh, wee, I see, your girl ain't a freak like me or Adina ha
Can't fade the rhinoceros of rap Lil Kim a pussy
How proposterous is that

I got no time for fake niggas
Just sip some cristal with with these real niggas
From east to west coast spread love nigga
And while you keep talkin shit we countin bank figures (Repeat 3x)

Right back at cha the one Cleopatra
Diggin in your stash
(Niggas think they gonna get some ass)
No money money, no licky licky fuck your sticky sticky and your quicky
Gimmie your loot ya mack 11 didn't shoot
Your game ain't sweet
John Paul Peach shouldn't compete if you can't wet it, forget it, don't sweat
it, I bet it make you cum smooth if you let Ha
You can't stop a chick from ballin
Ha Ha, the la-las, the drop-bys they be callin
And you ain't know while you be kickin that old shit
We makin hits
Platinium an Glod shit
I stay draped in diamonds and pearls
Beside every man is a bad girl

I got no time for fake niggas
Just sip some cristal with with these real niggas
From east to west coast spread love nigga
And while you keep talkin shit we countin bank figures (Repeat until fade)
