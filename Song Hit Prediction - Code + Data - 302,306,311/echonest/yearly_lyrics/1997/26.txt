Babyface: Every Time I Close My Eyes
--------------------------------------

Girl, it's been a long, long time comin', yes it has
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait, yeah
It feels like springtime in winter  
It feels like Christmas in June  
It feels like heaven has opened up its gates for me and you

Every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it 
I pinch myself 'cos I don't believe it's true
That someone like you loves me too

Girl, I think that you're truly somethin', yes you are
And you're every bit of a dream come true, yes you are
With you baby, it never rains and it's no wonder 
Sun always shines when I'm near you 
It's just a blessing that I have found somebody like you

Every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it 
I pinch myself 'cos I don't believe it's true
That someone like you loves me too

To think of all the nights I've cried myself to sleep 
You really ought to know how much you mean to me
It's only right that you'll be in my life
Right here with me, oh baby, baby, yeah

Every time I close my eyes
I thank the Lord that I've got you
And you've got me too
And every time I think of it 
I pinch myself 'cos I don't believe it's true
That someone like you loves me too
