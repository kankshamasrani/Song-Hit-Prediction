The Platters: (You've Got) The Magic Touch
--------------------------------------------

You-oo-'ve got the magic touch (woo-oo)
It makes me glow so much (oo-woo-oo)
It casts a spell, it rings a bell
The magic touch

Oh-uh-oh when I feel your charm (woo-oo)
It's like a fourth alarm (oo-woo-oo)
You make me thrill so much
You've got the magic touch

If I go reeling, uh-oh
I'm feeling the glow (uh-oh)
But where can I go from you

I didn't know too much (woo-oo)
And then I felt your touch (oo-woo-oo)
And now I've learned I can return
The magic touch

If I go reeling, uh-oh
I'm feeling the glow (uh-oh)
But where can I go from you

I didn't know too much (woo-oo)
And then I felt your touch (oo-woo-oo)
And now I've learned I can return
The magic touch
(Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-dooooo)
