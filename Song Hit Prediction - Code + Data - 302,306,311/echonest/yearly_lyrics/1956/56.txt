Dungaree doll, dungaree doll, paint your initials on my jeans
So everyone in town will know we go around together, together, together
Dungaree doll, dungaree doll, paste my picture on your sleeve
So everyone can see that you belong to me, forever, forever, forever

I want you to wear my orange sweater
The beat up sweater with the high school letter
Gonna make a chain of paperclips
And chain us together while I kiss your lips

Dungaree doll, dungaree doll promise me you never will fall
For any other guy, tell me you are my
Dungaree, Dungaree, Dungaree, Dungaree, Dungaree, Dungaree,Doll
Dungaree doll, dungaree doll, paste my picture on your sleeve

So everyone can see that you belong to me, forever, forever, forever
I want you to wear my orange sweater
The beat up sweater with the high school letter
Gonna make a chain of paperclips

And chain us together while I kiss your lips
Dungaree doll, dungaree doll promise me you never will fall
For any other guy, tell me you are my
