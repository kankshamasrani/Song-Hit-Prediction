Nat King Cole: Night Lights
-----------------------------

-Artist: Nat King Cole

-Words by Sammy Gallop and Music by Chester Conn


Night lights, those blues-in-the-night lights
Are no longer bright lights since I'm without you
Sweet dreams, oh where did they fly to?
You're gone and who can I cry to?

Those night lights remind me of bright eyes
And beautiful white lies too good to be true
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray
That those night lights will lead me to you

<instrumental interlude>

Those night lights remind me of bright eyes
And beautiful white lies too good to be true
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray
That those night lights will lead me to you
