Pat Boone: I'll Be Home
-------------------------

I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me (wait for me)
We'll stroll along together
Once more our love will be free

At the corner drugstore
Each Saturday we would meet (we would meet)
I'd walk you home in the moonlight
All of these things we'll repeat

So darling, as I write this letter
Here's hoping you're thinking of me
My mind's made up'.
So long until I'll be home to start serving you

I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me (wait for me)
I'd walk you home in the moonlight 
Once more our love will be free

SPOKEN: Darling, as I write this letter, here's hoping you're 
thinking of me.  My mind's made up'. 
so long until I'll be home to start serving you.

I'll be home, my darling
Please wait for me (wait for me)
I'll walk you home in the moonlight 
Once more our love will be free
