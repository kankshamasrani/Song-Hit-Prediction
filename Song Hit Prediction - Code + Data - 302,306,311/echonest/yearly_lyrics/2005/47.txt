Bobby Valentino - Slow Down 
2004 

I saw you walking 
Down on Melrose 
You looked like an angel 
Straight out of heaven, girl 
I was blown away by 
Your sexiness 
All I have to do is catch up to you 

Hook: 
Slow down I just wanna get to know you 
But don't turn around 
Cuz that pretty round thing looks good to me 
Slow down never seen anything so lovely 
Now turn around 
And bless me with your beauty, cutie 

A butterfly tattoo 
Right above your naval 
Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl 
Come take a walk with me 
You'll be impressed by 
The game that I kick to you 
It's over-rollin' with you yeah 

Bridge: 
Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready 
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready 
And we all can use shine like the sun 
Let me be the one to enjoy you 
Let's kick it girl 

(Hook x2) 

Oh baby you know by now that I want you bad 
I'm floating on open air I can't come down 
Cupid hit me already damn 
Now I can't leave till seven digits are in my hand, my hand 

(Bridge) 

(Hook x2) 

Slow down never seen anything so lovely 
Cutie 

(Hook)
